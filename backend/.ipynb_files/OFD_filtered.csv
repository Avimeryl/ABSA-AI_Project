"Foodpanda wants you to BEG for refunds I know there are still a lot of Foodpanda users out here despite of their not so pleasant experiences when things go wrong on their orders. I am sharing this post as a tip to everyone so that you are aware of the current situation of things especially new users who doesn't have a clue. Here goes the list.. 

1.) They DON'T REFUND for OUT OF STOCK items paid by CASH VOUCHERS (lazada or shoppee). 
Their system only sees it as you are not maximizing the voucher value. YOUR LOSS = PROFIT TO THEM

Example buy 3 bottle of nescafe coffee but 1 bottle is out of stock. That out of stock is considered burn/forfeited from the original cash voucher and won't be refunded. Next time you want to order, make sure you go to the store and get confirmation from the store manager whether they have stock first before you order anything. 

2.) Customer service is non existent. 
Impossible to get live chat with live human agent. Suspect that all is running on AI chatbots which can spew scripted replies and close your ticket within 10 minutes or less. 

In the past, it is still possible to get a refund for 1.) because human agents are not mindless bots. 

3.) Facebook admin suspected to be a chatbot as well
The admin is always online and replies to your posts/comments with multiple language support and scripted replies very promptly. It is capable of deleting comments and also ban users who are CRITICAL about their services as well. In order words, your NEGATIVE posts on their Facebook would be deleted and you would be BANNED as a damage control if you continously comment on their poor services

4.) Reporting to KPDN / tribunal is not worth due to the small claim amount 
You still have to attend the tribunal hearing at their office and incur time cost by taking leave from work, parking, petrol, transport charges, etc. They know this so they would IGNORE KPDN threats from customers.

5.).... Feel free to continue from hereband add to this post about your BAD EXPERIENCE with them.

The objective is to remind everyone not to waste anymore time using their services as they wouldn't even care if you have to BEG them for REFUNDS or raise your blood pressures in doing so. In their perception, they have so much of customers that losing a few doesn't even make a dent in their profits. Stop using foodpanda, shoppeefood is currently the best on the market. || Deleted the app right after pandemic. Faced various issues and had to follow up emails after emails for refunds and include so many justifications for their own mistake. Haven’t been using for almost 4 years!

However, if you live in Klang Valley you have alternatives, some outskirt folks only have this app as main food delivery. As much as Grab also has issues, it sucks lesser than FP 

The app sucks
The promo sucks
The CS sucks || I ordered dominoes, the app says its still on the way after an hour, we got fed up waiting. Turns out the app was frozen on the driver delivering screen, even after we refreshed it, we called dominoes, they didn’t end up delivering the food. We went to the actual store (we should’ve prob drove there in first place but I wanted to surprise my sis and bro in law since they are exhausted from work) and walla, our food was there at the back of the kitchen.

The workers there are like, we thought it was cancelled but you can still pick them up now? I was soo confused and pissed. But then I knew I’d be getting some cold ass pizzas if I took it, so a 80RM refund sounds more delicious. I didn’t take it and kept calling foodpanda and got the refund.

This is during the time I first started working and couldn’t get a cc so I was using debit.

Deleted the app after the refund. Never gone back to FP, not worth it. That is 3 years ago. 😊 || When you order food on foodpanda, there is an option on what to do if the item is out of stock. The default setting is ‘remove from my order’, but you can also choose ‘call me’ or ‘cancel the whole order’. 

Obviously the call me option is best, but if you choose ‘cancel the whole order’, your voucher will be returned to your foodpanda wallet. 

Granted, I only use foodpanda for food delivery, so I’m not sure if they have this option for grocery delivery. 

Also, I usually use the chat feature for problems with my delivery (food spilled, missing items etc) and usually get good resolutions. I mean, they usually refund the cost of the food item, I’m not asking them for more than the food cost. 

So I will take that voucher and use it for my next orders. (I usually ask for vouchers, not for refunds on my credit card. The money is already out of my account.. so the voucher is ‘free’ #GirlMath) || 4) credit card chargeback - I was successful. || Hahahah

Their Facebook is definitely automated || The issue here is no real human dealing with the issue. Sadly company nowadays want to cut cost, all uses AI to replace customer service.  || I use panda because it's a bit cheaper than grab. i don't have to pay for transport there and back. i don't have to deal with makcik membawang dan orang membebel. plus i can browse as long as i like without any trouble. 

when panda is being really shirty i get around the no cash refund by just opting for cash payment and then do QR or online bank transfer with the rider. Panda can't take your money if you never gave it to them in the 1st place. || Foodpanda has the worst refund. It took 14 days for me. Grab and Misi have an instant refund credited to your account wallet. Foodpanda refund backs to your bank so it took longer || Dang, never heard of any of this before. My fam and I use fopanda near daily. Never had more of a problem than drinks being spilled or wrong food item sent. Always got a refund when that happened or we'd get a voucher. Refunds were usually back into payment option withing a few minutes. We pay with tng ewallet tho. A few days ago, got the 2 for 1 deal from Marry Brown and instead of 2 lucky plates we got 2 nasi lemak. Talked with the chat bot for 5 mins and got a rm45 voucher. Though yeah, ai chatbots aren't great."
"Cancelled my order on FoodPanda and Still didn't get my refund  Pretty sure this falls under KPDNHEP authority to mediate. || Update: Contacted them via Insta page and went front and back a bit before they tried to ask me to wait 5-7 days, I told them i wont wait and will raise a dispute with them thru  KPDNHEP, they instantly folded and refunded. 

FoodPanda policy 6.9 is stupid as fuck.   
  
""6.9 Refunds

(i) Online Payment Orders

You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order.""

Honestly this is dumb, what I pretty much understand here is that once a vendor has accepted your order even if the food isn't made, your money is theirs now and threes nothing you can do about it unless you threaten food panda with legal actions. || For context, I originally wanted to order A&W for dinner after I got back home from work, which I then cancelled after a few seconds since my friend offered to take me out to dinner.  I noticed that my TnG money was deducted and realise it was from foodpanda, i gave it a few hours before deciding I would raise a support case with a live agent to only realise they removed the option of connecting to a live agent and instead just shove a ""Send us your enquire and we will get back to you soonest possible instead of resolving the issue now"".  Just to be met with this. Ive tried contacting them through their email, but get similar copy pasta response to this.

Any way i can get back my money? Im a college student already trying to make end meet and my only source of income is my part time job which is bare minimum wage || Foodpanda refund is slow. I get my money back in around 14 days. But you need to keep calling their customers support || i think just query them everyday about the issue and preservere,   
pray that you get decent customer service executive that care enough to help you.   
panda always like this, if get bad cs = no refund/min refund. || Must got story....i got refund from FoodPanda and Grab everytime. Especially FP is lightning fast. || so how would the process be like then? How do i get started? || I kena once with panda like u. Cancelled coz ordered diff things coz initial order took too long. Tried call many times they said cant refund. Apparently seems like the people answer are just junior that being told blanket statement cant refund. After escalation i got my money back. 

In your case just report online kpdnhep that should be quick || Few ways, I believe they have a WhatsApp line and email address for complaints. I'd use the email route so I can CC FoodPanda and make them squirm in sweat.

But if Whatsapp is easier, go ahead

They have a portal to make complaints [here](https://e-aduan.kpdn.gov.my/kepenggunaan)

The WhatsApp link and email is there too || Contacted them via Insta page and went front and back a bit before they tried to ask me to wait 5-7 days, I told them i wont wait and will raise a dispute with them thru  KPDNHEP, they instantly folded and refunded.

"Foodpanda vs grab vs shopeefood  using all 3.

shopeefood - when wanna buy from short range vendor due to delivery voucher, normally spend rm15-20 for lunch & dinner. pros: no need to spend rm25 for delivery voucher. cons; delivery voucher insufficient to cover far vendor delivery fee. 

foodpanda - when wanna buy from short to medium range vendor, with delivery voucher and panda pro voucher, average spending is rm20-23, for lunch and dinner. (pandapro voucher - rm5 unlimited, rm10 x 3, 35% voucher x 5) , cons; sometimes 1-2 hour delivery time, no free delivery when spend rm100+

grab, same as panda but grabfood pro used to suck (zero food voucher) but now they give rm7 voucher for orders of rm25, average spending is around rm18 - 23, for lunch and dinner. (grab voucher limited to rm7 x 10); cons: limited voucher, grabfood pro delivery discount insufficient to cover far vendor delivery fee. idk why name is ""grab food unlimited"" if voucher is limited."
"Foodpanda rider spilled drink, no refund Ordered two drinks from foodpanda. The foodpanda rider took a picture of the drinks being delivered before one fell, customer service said no refund.

They claimed they tried contacting me, but I didn’t receive anything. They insisted I was unreachable and closed the investigation.

I have a picture of the rider holding the spilled drink right there. If I were to spill them myself, why would he be holding the spilled drink for me to take a picture of.

Say what you want about Grab, at least the customer service there is less rigid. Grab would’ve just offered a refund. Foodpanda merely copy pasted the same response over and over again. Rise dispute again || Keep complaining and don’t let them close ticket.

I have complained several dozens of times and gotten some kind of compensation for almost all of them.

I might try mentioning KPDN next time i have an issue. || Amen. A similar thing happened to me, with one ordered item missing, and the pack was sealed. Complained to FP but they denied it, saying the same evasive shit. I called the shop back and was not answered. 

I stopped using FP immediately after. Real twats. || I don't mean to make this about me. But generally I stop using food panda cuz of how shitty the drivers are and the help services
Report this and change food delivery apps. || I find it astounding how people still use FP. Absolute crap company. || Report again || I used to be a student in shah alam and the road to get to my dorm is a huge pain in the ass for food delivery riders to have water with them. 


Theres a few that has spilled my drink and from my experience, the older riders usually tend to offer compensation while the younger ones didnt even mention anything up until you open your order lmao. 

Mfs be crazy || Update: We did it! I attached a screenshot of the KPDN report I made and started a new dispute, they immediately offered a refund. ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26561) || And then there's actually people on this sub claiming FP cs isn't problematic at all. Which made me wondered if they've improved over the years.

This post just showed it's the same old nonsense. || I never have problem with refunds on FP but the fact that i have more complaints with FP than Grab says something. Ditch FP for grab even though im not afan of grab cs but i know i won't be contacting them as much as when im with fp"
"foodpanda - fake 5 star ratings just wanted to put this out here. cos fuck foodpanda and their management. almost every store has 5 star? got scammed into eating terrible food. but that’s not the issue, issue is fuck foodpanda and their management for not being able to be honest with their business practices. i hope they go bankrupt.  Rule #14405, never trust a star ratings on the internet. || People still take foodpanda? The delivery fee is insane. Back during covid, it was okay. Now just getting grabfood || Same as grab, sometimes they even  hide really bad review resturants  and show no rate. But  when you click  resturant  details  you will  see 2.6 star review. Now is almost impossible to complain  about bad food. They require photo then they don't  accept as evidence.  How the fck I can prove  food have funky spoil  taste with  photo. There is no live chat anymore.  No consumer  rights   || This is so annoying, I can’t trust this app. Such a dumb decision, make it so much harder to choose what to order. || I am more shocked I am unable to search for keyword ""free"" in google maps reviews when manual sort shows it. Clearly incentivized by giving free food for 5\* review. 

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7xCaVLBWC3mmL6C6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7xCaVLBWC3mmL6C6) || sure, but point here is foodpanda is way more outrageous || just stating my observation || there is a 1% charge when topping up your grab wallet too now || For credit cards right?"

Stole my food, refused to acknowledge rider/GPS problem (multiple times), and just ignored my request for refund. 3 hours dead hungry in the middle of the night. Hope they go bankrupt. || Never using FoodPanda ever again. I ordered twice only to have the orders arrive 90 minutes late on both occasions. My crispy fried chicken turned into lembab chicken on the first and maggi goreng turned into maggi lembab on the second.

Also, horrendous support (if there even is a customer support hotline)."
"GrabFood customer service is so bad I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order) I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

Orders being jammed at their centre and not sent to the merchants kitchen || Maybe can write to their management or complain to small tribunal court? || Foodpanda have more charges like their service tax and processing fees. Soo i save some money using grab || The thing is they did refund the cost of the meal, so going to the tribunal wont net me much since it's hard to quantify the value of inconvenience. || Ooh, full refund already. Aiyah, sudahlah. What do you expect from riders man...they're rempits, don't expect Butler service lor. As long money back, I am fine. I have waited for over 2 hours for stupid KFC delivery (using KFC app). I got fed up, I left for dinner. Then later rider comes and call me, I ignore. I use COD. No chicken, no cash for you. Lol.

"Beware of the TNG RM5 for RM120 Voucher Pack Scam! [Voucherpack\_June\_webbanner.png](https://preview.redd.it/mmja1gwe8g7d1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=697650458b9752541c61f26afcef564b3322127c)

I just fell for what I believe is a misleading promotion by Touch 'n Go (TNG) eWallet, and I want to warn others before they waste their money. Here’s what happened:

# The ""Deal""

TNG is running an ad in their eWallet app promising RM120 worth of vouchers for just RM5. Sounds amazing, right? I thought so too and quickly paid the RM5.

# The Reality

After paying, I received ELEVEN (11) vouchers, but here’s the catch that wasn't clearly communicated upfront:

* **Minimum Spend Requirements:** Each voucher requires a minimum spend to be usable. For example:
   * RM8 Prepaid Voucher requires a RM60 top-up.
   * RM6 Foodpanda Voucher requires a RM100 purchase.
   * RM40 CarInsure Voucher requires a RM600 insurance premium.
* **Short Validity Periods:** Most vouchers are only valid for 5 days, making it nearly impossible to use them unless you were already planning to spend a lot within that short timeframe.

# Misleading Marketing

The initial ad conveniently omits these crucial details, only revealing them deep in the terms and conditions. This kind of hidden information feels incredibly deceptive and preys on users looking for a good deal.

# Final Thoughts

It’s really frustrating to see such tactics. RM5 might not seem like much, but it’s the principle of being tricked that really stings.

Stay cautious, everyone!

[Mid Year Mega Voucher Pack | Touch 'n Go (touchngo.com.my)](https://www.touchngo.com.my/promotion/mid-year-mega-voucher-pack/) You could lodge a complain to KPDN about deceptive marketing tactics || I stopped caring about TNG points because their vouchers are a scam and always out of stock. || RM5 donation to TnG || Not excusing what T&G did in anyway, but keep in mind to read the T&C next time. 

I just checked the promo on the App, and the T&C is provided in the link below listing out the available vouchers and the minimum spend requirement.

[https://www.facebook.com/share/p/8vseLdZshEQCSZ9y/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/8vseLdZshEQCSZ9y/) What does food panda have to do with this? Half the riders just grab the bag without checking properly sometimes. Food panda is just connecting buyer to seller.

Don't need to start business in Malaysia anymore. Always wanted to but if I really do plan to go ahead, maybe in another country. || But was the babi good though? || Lucky. They got to taste babi without being sinful since it's not intentional. || What's the title supposed to imply?

The rider obviously made a mistake. It's not the first time this has happened and it won't be the last, given how food delivery services began the practice of stacking multiple deliveries on the same rider at a time years ago. || Got char kuey teow without the char once from FoodPanda. || Obviously riders fault, I also have received mcd beef burger when I order chicken burger (rider send wrong order not mcd). 

Or recvd neighbours order when I didn’t order anything. || The rider must be doing multiple orders at the same time. Once the rider came with multiple orders and took the wrong bag for me. Luckily I was his first stop and the other order was from a different place and can see through plastic what was the food.

For this case, if it's so important, you as parents should've ensured everything is right for your kids to consume. Mak sibuk online class, bapak order pas tu pi mana? Attend online class mak? Delivery rider may be at fault but you're equally at fault too. FB comment asking to saman on what basis 😂 rider Kasi salah makanan, ibu sibuk, bapak hilang lepas buat order, pastu anak termakan babi? || It's a string of error from Foodpanda to the receiving customer, but die die also wanna blame and boikot Foodpanda, a company which is employing a few villages of type M riders... 

Just that night I received a wrong delivery of a birthday cake. The driver was correct because he just followed the address, but we called him back and he did come to re-collect the cake though he didn't know where to deliver it next. Shows that if customers do their part to check the items, the problem wouldn't have escalated until then consuming non-halal items.

"What Can Outsider do When Friend is Being Abused by Her Parent? Sorry if my England isn't that good but I'm trying to help my friend but I am not good with Laws and Police Enforcement.. 

This is going to be a long story to this situation, I have a friend who is now 25, Female. She is living with her brother, and mother. We were friends since middle school and roughly 2 - 3 years ago. Her father passed away, and us (friend group) have been finding some weird things happening in her family. 

She has to work a full time job and go home to cook, clean, the house daily. And sometimes even until 10PM she told us she had to clean the house before sleep.(Had to sleep late until her older brother finishes his meal and wash his dishes). Her mother is unemployed and roughly at the age of 40+. And have been asking my friend to do all the house chores while mother do nothing.

  
Her mother has been fetching them to work daily and never allowed them to drive. They have 2 cars and one was new (bought by brother but the mother wants daughter to pay some). And we noticed some strange interaction with her family about 2 or 3 years ago (After fathers passing).

We went out for friend dinner to celebrate her birthday, 6PM. Her mother called her and scolded her for not ordering food for them (mom and brother). We asked cant his brother order foodpands? She told us ""AIyah, my brother doesn't know how to use these apps"". We were shocked, as the mother called her not just once, but THREE times during that day just to constantly rush her to order foodpanda over to them. 

Soon after when we were all slowly living our lives (work, graduation, away from hometown). She is starting to struggle to look for a job, which then my sister recommended her a new job position. She finally started having a stable social life and even got herself a boyfriend! We were so happy for her because we thought she might finally be able to move out from home. And this is where everything goes down.

Another day us friend group meet up we noticed her hand is having serious skin issues (gotten worse). And she told us its due to chemicals from the dish soap. And until now it has never been cured. We told her to stop washing plates or maybe wear gloves but she is not doing it. Fast forward to where she was dating.  The boyfriend bought her a dishwasher. But the mother was very pissed off about it. Saying that ""My daughter can do it why do we need this?"" The boyfriend explained it to the mother and she wasn't pleased about it. And slowly pressuring the daughter. Whenever they went out on a date and come back home before 10PM. the mother would scream at her and boyfriend. Scolding them and insulting them. Forcing them to break up. And that stopped them from going out on a date (Must bring the mother along).  


Soon after the mother knowing that it wont separate them. She started to blame my sister (And the company) By going to the company front door and scream. Saying they ""changed"" her daughter. Until they have to call the police. Soon after the mother never bring her to work. Threw her alone on the roadside and drove off. One day the mother said she is bringing her to work. But ended up going to her relatives house, and to the boyfriends house to fight with them. And to really make them break up, the mother beat her everyday after work until they willing to breakup. They ended up broken up. 

  
Today she didn't go to work again. She was locked at home and got beaten up by her mother again. The boss from the office never fired her because they want to help her. But does not know how. They wanted to call the police but are afraid she might have no where to stay after all that happened.  I am wondering what can we do as an outsider to help her, we tried talking to her for years but nothing has changed. This time it went too far and the police thing makes everyone worried if it will ruin her future... Anyone here have similar issues of living with an abusive family? How do you get out from it? How would you resolve this issue? I would definitely report this abuse to the police. Your friend would be better off on her own if her family is taking advantage of her like this. Your friend deserves better. 

Also I respect your care and concern and it shows your upstanding character. || Right, okay, where do I begin. 

The Women's Aid Organisation has a lot of good resources for this, including this portion addressed to people who believe their friend may be suffering from domestic violence: 

What you can do
- Listen to your friend and do not judge. Assure them that the abuse isn’t their fault.
- Ask your friend what they would like to do and respect their choices.
- Share with them the WAO Hotline (+603 3000 8858) or SMS/WhatsApp line (018 988 8058).
- If your friend would like to take action, you can accompany them to the police station to make a police report.
- If your friend is injured and wants medical care, you can accompany them to the “One Stop Crisis Centre” located in the emergency room of government hospitals.
- If you are unsure how to respond, you can call us at +603 3000 8858 or SMS/WhatsApp 018 988 8058 for guidance.

Their website is http://wao.org.my and I would suggest familiarising yourself with their content too, so you can supply assistance to your friend if/when she seeks it. 

There are legal recourses- the Malaysian Domestic Violence Act doesn't just cover violence committed against a spouse, but also against an adult family member. If your friend chooses, a court protection order could restrict her mother from entering her place of residence, work, or coming within 50 metres of her. If a court decides there is a risk of a violent contravention of the protection order, it could also attach an arrest order to it, meaning if her mother does violate the protection order she would be arrested. The WAO also runs shelters for domestic violence survivors and can advise on all of this in more detail. 

On a personal level as someone who has experience of the abusive cycle, it is down to your friend to make the decision to leave. But she may feel like she has no choice and no options, which is where you can come in to assist with the options I've detailed above. However, escaping the abuser is only the start of the battle- pressure on survivors to brush abuse aside and ""not air dirty laundry"" is strong. It is vital that your friend, if she chooses to make this change, receive support both from mental help professionals as well as from like-minded communities, so that she doesn't get drawn back into her abusers' orbit. 

On a personal note, I keep a folder of my abusers' messages to show anyone who tries to tell me ""it wasn't that bad"" or to minimise my experience. It's a reasonably effective way to get people to shut up about what they know nothing about. || Seems like a classic case of abuse and the victim very docile. She has a job, her workplace wants to help her, she is financially independent. She can literally just walk away. Its up to her to choose. || Thank you for all the suggestions and Ideas. Fortunately the boss from her work company decided to call the police. She is now at the police station but that is all the information i got. (I'm not around her area) 

So far telling her to move out or be ""independent"" doesn't work at all. We have been trying to tell her that for years and whenever we say that she just ignores all of our messages. 

We soon understand that she is actually afraid. She once said ""If i ever stand up for myself, i might not have any family to go back to anymore""
I strongly believe she is afraid of losing her family and no one to lean on etc, which I can somehow understand since she grew up having little friends and always has to stay home. It's like how some parents will always brainwash their kids saying ""No one treats you better like your family"" Idealogy which so we all stopped telling her that and told her it was all up to her from now. and we said that last year... So it's been so long and things just got worse. || Video tape (as a records evidence in the future), as police wont do shit. The old mother not gonna change.   

The best, get out and living totally out of touch with the family, however, this required temporarily financial aid/ loan + strong determination. Have to move out and stabilize, plan it perfectly, get all personal belongings and documents and run.

The house is inhabitable in a human perspective, police not gonna solve it verbally with the mom, jail is unlikely too. || [removed] || I always wonder if the girl is their own daughther for cases like this.

I mean, do they kidnapped some random baby girl from hospital 2 decades ago that they have the ability mistreated the girl?

Like baby elephant that forever thinking the piece of chain is sufficient to trap them for eternity.

I bet she has been abused since eon and unable to think that she can escape just by calling the police. 

It is already at this stage, I don't think she has the ability to break the chain herself. I mean, she has already working, had boyfriend etc but she never able to do tiny rebellion at home. 

If you know neighbour that can record incidents that they witness, would that help in this kind of cases? || You can't change anything for her.. Only she can decide to move out and block them || As hard as it is, I would recommend you guys as a group of friends (and her boyfriend) get her out of the house if you can (without breaking any laws of course)  and get her to cut off contact. It won’t be easy especially for her, but as long as she is under her mum’s thumb, your friend will never get the freedom she needs. 

Strangely, my GF has a friend in a similar situation with an abusive mother. She works in a big furniture retail store and is forced by her mother to give her money from her salary and to do all the chores and gets regularly abused. Unfortunately, it seems to have affected her confidence so she’s stuck in an endless loop with her mother which is a shame because my GF always thought she was really talented and could do way more but is being stopped by her own mother || Brother I feel you but the first step is that she has to be willing to get out. From the sound of her family, it looks like she's better on her own. As to who would be willing to take her in, short term can't you look into temporary living situation with renting first?

What I'm concerned about reading this is that you guys seems to want to help, but if you have already talked to her for years, and she's not receptive of help, then it's all moot. Try to see if she actually wants out or not, what her worries are about leaving her current toxic environment, and take it step by step to see what can you do to help. You can't help those who doesn't want to help themselves."
"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story. Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

 I was expecting one of the lessons learned to be ‘Never get business advice from r/malaysia’!

But joking aside, ay bro, may you come out from this stronger and wiser. You did good overall. || One of the best pieces of working I’ve read here in a long while.  And maybe on Reddit too. 

Many nuggets gleaned. Mucho gracias. || I wish you better outcome in your next venture, OP. || I've been in FnB business for a decade,built from zero. You must go all in in order to succeed, and about the family part, it goes for every business. Just don't mix business with family. || Thanks for sharing your experience OP, really appreciated your stories, I really need that because I'm about to open my business here in kuching selling beignets

guess I gotta give it All In.

Wish me luck! 🤞🏻 || Curious of this brand as some people touted this as local brand alternative to KFC. Finally decided to give it a try during the recent bazar Ramadan.


The chicken were bland. The sauces were bland. Like no salt and seasonings at all. And like OP said, they only sell chicken and sauces. With price not cheaper than KFC. The batter was ok, I guess 


Anyways, all the best for OP. I'll stick with KFC and McD for the time being || i have been a retail biz owner almost 2 decades...ppl ask me whats most important? they usually think...marketing...or sales...etc..  

The answer is... HR. as a boss, my most important job is to manage HR...keep staff happy, keep my managers happy, everything else is easy. || Sounds like you learned some important life lessons first hand. All the best for the remaining ventures and frayed family ties || It's always management when comes to business
If u can manage it right, it will be smooth

But humans are the most complicated things to manage, so it's always pain in the ass to deal with

Lastly, getting family/partner/friends involve it's a big no-no, which I very agree on

Unless you have brief the other about the business concept n the mindset + understanding of business operations, you could try.

But if after hearing all that n the person has disagreement or doesn't buy your concepts, forget it.

But well done man, u did what u could. Business it's not easy to run when you're the only person that manage everything including staff n finance, it's a huge dilemma n pain in the ass. || Are you based in KV? There are almost 10 or more MHC stalls in KV when I googled it. Would love to buy some fried chickens from you before you close your stall for good.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Wishing you all the best in your next endeavor."
"Can someone explain Why a place that is 0.9 Km away costs 10 rm delivery fee in Foodpanda? it was never like this, All shops fees have gone to the roof. Am I missing something?  Holiday season and shortages of riders

You might as well opt for pick up || Because most of the riders are malays and they are celebrating hari raya thus creating a high demand for riders but there aren't any riders around thus the system increase the price to entice the riders but there are still no riders to take the order and increase the price again. || [deleted] || Yeah I started walking to restaurants. They bleed my wallet dry during Ramadan. Delivery cost more than the food 😔.

They even mark up the food prices in the delivery app. || Holiday season tends to do that. || Rempit still on holiday. || I used grabfood literally 20mins ago, and they cancelled my order twice because there was no rider. In the end i just gone to the restaurant myself and order there."
"Food delivery services What food delivery services do y’all use more often? 

I personally use Foodpanda but my experience with them is utter garbage. Delivery took estimated 1 hour 30 mins even if the restaurant is 30 minutes away and customer service was so poor. I use grab just because it's faster for me. I feel foodpanda always takes longer, maybe there's just more grab drivers around me. || I feel like foodpanda is cheaper and since I subbed, it’s more worth it. || Damn. Where do you live bro? I use both depending on what I want to eat. I only had problem with Grab once (missing order) and twice with Panda (same problem). || Grab || grab is ok if you don't order at peak hour but if you order during a weekend night... my food takes like close to 1.5 hours for a shop that's 5 mins from my house. very disappointing. || Here is what I use chronologically. Pre covid years, first food delivery service I use was The Noble Rider. Then Morefun.

During covid years, Food panda, then move on to grab food

Post covid years till now mostly grabfood. Of all, morefun is more fun to use, cheap and reliable but now kinda like cease to exist. Stuck with grab. The last time i use grabfood was like december last year. I learn to cook now and it's much more cheaper. || grab always refunds if there's a wrong order"
"Ordering Foodpanda/Grab while it's raining? So my family have been having these doubts between us, whether should we order while it's raining..

My mother said do not order anything from them while it's raining, as poor those riders.

Me on the other hand, always gives tips (RM2-RM5) depends on how heavy it is, thinking that what if they don't have enough profits for the day. 

This thing has been back and forth, now I'm truly want to ask for people opinions, or even riders here would be better. Can we order while it's raining? Or don't order as we will be just endangering your life?



TL;DR (Malay) : Boleh ke tak order foodpanda/grab masa hujan? Menyusahkan atau mmg riders perlu duit walaupun hujan? I always tip when it's raining. And. Importantly. Wish them a safe ride.

It's a job. Your mum should feel worse to stop you using the service and paying their fee. Unless your mum doesn't want you to order delivery - but that's a different issue altogether ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26557) || They are not charity workers or being forced. They do get paid.  They want to take the risk then it's their own decision whatever happens. || Should be ok, they are not permanent staff that get fixed monthly salary right || So to riders i can always message them say “sokay its rain no need rush” so they can just wait, but from their side, do they have timeout from fp/grab? || Eh you can. It doesn't matter, the pay is usually much better when it's raining. 

However, cannot guarantee your food will be delivered fast enough lah. Usually for me I'll stop somewhere if the rain is heavy or thunderstorm. || Given how hard they're having it (owing to the strike ytdy), tipping is decent. *Just be understanding to them if food arrives late*. I waited 2 hrs for a burrito since it rained otw, no reprimand needed.

You can try to order when it rains, however, the restaurant may cancel your order instead! Or most will say 'delivery will be back soon', depending on your area.

Tldr, I don't order when it's heavy and always have a plan B if I didn't bawa bekal to office. || If it rains heavily I don’t order immediately. If it drizzles i’ll order and make sure to tip even if it’s just rm2-5 || Hi, I'm a rider and I think you don't have to feel sorry if you want to order during the rain. The reason is that riders are given option to pause or continue working during the rain. Me myself, usually I would pause my shift if it's a heavy rain. Some other riders will continue working. But do expect delay because usually there are more riders that pause during the rain and all the active order will go to the riders that didn't pause. So please be patient if your orders are late. Also it would be appreciated if you could tip them because working during the rain is kinda dangerous and tedious because some malls will not allow riders to wear their rain suit inside and we need to take off the rain suit before entering and then put in on again before delivering the orders. Anyhow don't feel guilty ordering during the rain as the riders that choose to continue working during the rain expect the orders to be non stop and it's beneficial for them. || Don't. As a rider myself, one thing is, yes, safety, but your food will be extremely late and by the time reach you, dah tak sedap. Who wants to eat soggy , cold, fries or noodles. || If it rains, I always tip the rider... I think its the fair thing to do. Sometimes I give them a can drink or KitKat for the effort."
"Foodpanda Refunds Hey all! i figured i’d come here for advice.

I ordered food through foodpanda this morning and the restaurant called me saying their items were out of stock. Then proceeded to cancel the order and they agreed. Foodpanda agent then called me saying that they will not refund me considering the restaurant has prepared my order. I proceeded to tell the agent that the restaurant themselves told me they were out of stock, how could have they prepared it? And then the agent told me to claim through the app and she will refund it for me. I have then tried to talk to live agents and two different agents told me i am not able to be refunded considering the restaurant has already prepared the food and it’s a waste. To confirm their statement, i called the restaurant if they have prepared it and they said they didnt prepare anything. I’m at a loss and pretty upset that this happened. Any advice would really be helpful and appreciated deeply.

Sincerely,
A broke college student Email them again with all the details and timeline, but this time u cc kpdnhep || Yeah, next time use other delivery services. GrabFood customer service is great, and refunds you less than 30mins. However, highly expensive and grabfoodunlimited deals are actually limited.

My collegue uses ShopeeFood a lot and its super cheap compared to GrabFood if you compare the same store prices. In addition, if you are familiar with Shopee's coupon discount, there are tons of it in ShopeeFood. We usually buy bulk for lunch in office and got discount up to rm30! I don't have any experience with ShopeeFood CS so can't comment on that. || not the first time I saw complaints about foodpanda customer service, just avoid using them next time.

I avoided foodpanda since they outsource their agents, who have no idea what they are doing at all. Solely used grabfood, refund process takes 5-10 mins only after submitting claim. Their customer service also local people, with proper english. || I stopped ordering from Foodpanda. Always GrabFood.

Twice, I have ordered at a restaurant that is still available in GrabFood but they are actually closed permanently. I cancelled my order and got my money back. || Report to kpdnkk, don't waste time with those stupid foodpanda cs || Hey OP, I've previously faced issues with foodpanda before. Pretty much just file a complain to  kpdnhep and they will handle the rest for you. I was contacted by foodpanda CS team after about 3 weeks, issued me a refund + a voucher || Foodpanda is the worst for getting refunds. Even if you get a valid refund (like food damaged, I kena they deliver so bad drink spillage all over my food) they will nickel and dime you. Meanwhile Grab will just terus give you the refund as long as can provide the pics and stuff. So I always go grab now since a few months back.

Not to mention foodpanda some of the deals and offers won't apply to you or they will just hide from your account. Really waste of time and money. The deals and offers look really good la which is why it is appealing but really not worth it in the long run everytime got issues. || Did you initiate the cancellation or did the restaurant initiate the cancellation? || Pernah order makanan tapi tak sampai masa pkp dulu. Chat dengan CS, the first guy kata makanan dah sampai tak boleh refund etc., then left probably because he ended his shift or something idk, and another person replace the guy (can see the name of operator changed) lepastu explain balik, and this new operator start refunding my money, took about 7 working days iirc. 

Conclusion: tengok nasib || The restaurant itself can cancel the order but nah they just throw it back to you."
"Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect? Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me? [https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

I would rather work part time for something else if i have the know how or network/social skills, because the uncertainty and how tiring the part time job is

The money will come later. || There's one post recently from 1 grab driver (KL area iirc) asking bout some opinion. If I'm not mistaken from his post,  your payrate is still the same regardless if it's rush hour or chill hour. If it's not in this subreddit, probably in r/bolehland. Good luck searching. || Grab take some % too from the fee. As general rule maybe say you get 50% from the fee. Considering petrol, maintenance etc. Maybe grab drivers can advise better. || I don't think you can. Not because of your age, but because Grab doesn't allow part-timers any longer. 

They changed their policies around 4 years ago. Before that, you could be a part time Grab driver as long as you're  21 and above.

Edit:
Sorry, you can be a Grab driver. I was misinformed. || Don't waste your time || work part time for event job || Agree with your advice. If I’m hiring, I’d rather pick someone with sales experience over driving a car around.

That RM 1,800 is guaranteed, consistent income for a fixed working schedule. I fear that Grab might tempt OP to work longer during slower days, comprising his/her time to focus on studying."
"Foodpanda wrongly delivered my order to another house As per title, a few days ago my order was wrongly delivered. The only way to get help is through their help center where the live agents or chatbots pops out. I have initiated dozens of chat support but they are absolutely useless provides 0 help. And they dont have hotline to call for help which is really frustrating

My question is has anyone faced this issue before ? How is this possible from foodpanda’s end, their riders made the mistake ended up the customers pay the price ??? I My man this is where my KPDNHEP message comes in.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive? Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually? It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive. But while waiting for the food, I can do other things like watch tv. 😂"
"GrabFood and FoodPanda prices So title says it all. For reference I stay around the KL area, recently. So far this is the first time I've experienced it and was hoping someone else could explain it to me? 


Like it's been 2 weeks since the holidays, why is GrabFood practically either unavailable(like before this month when I opened GrabFood, I had a lot of choices) or the delivery prices are insane?

These guys are just ""adult"" mat rempits || FB post from their page

[Female employee was hit for no reason]


A very serious incident happened in our store! The
delivery riders from Foodpanda threw things at our staff!


Here's what happened: we had an order waiting for 30
minutes, but the Foodpanda rider assigned to it had not arrived yet. So we notified the system, and they
arranged for a new rider to deliver the order.
After 45 minutes, the original rider arrived with another
friend. He argued with our staff because he was
unhappy that he was replaced. He then threw the
beverages at our female employee, who was scared
and started crying.


I told them that this behavior was inappropriate and that
we should calm down and talk it out. After some
arguments, the rider again threw the menu at me and
challenged us to call the police. He claimed that his
house was just behind our store. We were stunned and
mad at their attitude and behavior!
We want to clarify that we are not authorized to replace
delivery riders. We were just worried about keeping our
customers waiting and then filing a complaint in the
system. As it does not show that our store has
completed preparing the order.


On the day of the incident, we reported it to the police.
Unfortunately, they said no one was injured, and nothing
was damaged in the store. Therefore, they could not
take any action and only filed a report. No police officer
has contacted us to follow up on the situation!
We feel bad about this. Can't we seek justice for our
female employees against this kind of thuggish
behavior?
We have always taught our employees to treat people
with courtesy, whether they are customers or delivery
riders. Our employees must express gratitude when
delivering food.


We also understand and appreciate the riders' efforts in
delivering our food rain or shine. We even offer all-day
discounts to all delivery riders to show our appreciation.
We also want to emphasize that we have encountered
kind and responsible delivery riders. Rude delivery
riders are just a minority.
Lastly, we hope the delivery rider who caused the
incident can be punished accordingly and apologize to
our female employee. They should also guarantee that
they will not repeat this offense against anyone else!


Although we have reported this to FoodPanda, one of
the delivery riders is still delivering food, and it is
possible that he is using someone else's identity to
continue doing so! We hope that all businesses can be
more vigilant! || Police can’t take action? What the fuck? Really || the bigger bullshit is that our police cannot take action because no one was injured....

so if i throw shit at a balai is ok? coz no one is injured and nothing was damaged right?

the 2 riders should be caught immediately as they not only destroy business properties but also THREATEN them - if this is not a crime what is?

"Need help for money management for fresh grad! Hello students and fresh grad. Just want to know what is your average daily spending and cost of living in shah alam, selangor? I just finished my internship and working as Junior IT consultant (contract for 2 months, gonna rest after finish and find other jobs in data scientist related field after raya) with Rm2k salary (yea i know quite low but the workload is not that much huhu), tolak epf and socso got around Rm 1.8k. My average spending for food per day is around Rm 18 per day. Kadang rasa cam banyak 😅, kadang rasa normal. Makanan always tapau je, kalau weekdays biasa spend kat breakfast Rm 3-5, dinner Rm8-10. Weekends Rm 15-20 for 2/3 meals (i use foodpanda). But kalau member ajak lepak, kadang boleh cecah Rm 20-30 but that's an outliers.

Komitmen lain:

-Petrol: Rm 5-6 per week, Rm 20-24 per month (rumah sewa 2.5km dgn tempat kerja)

-House rent: Rm 210 (utilities included)

-Phone prepaid: Rm 20

-Toiletries: Rm 100 (sabun, toothfloss, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, etc)

-Entertainment: Rm14 per month (tgk wayang kalau ada movie mantap)

-Laundry: Rm 4 per week, Rm 16 per month (dobiqueen) 

1) should i cut something? 
2) how much should i save per month? 
3) should i buy raw stuff/ingredients and cook at home? how much can i save if i do so😅.

p/s: im happy the way im living right now, no pressure, but feel like fancy and boros sometimes because of my food spending. and i really miss the time when living with my parent, my mum's cooking, it's good and it's FREEEE🥲.

Thank you in advance! Might be worthwhile reposting this in r/malaysianpf || You spend a lot on food and toiletries, please consider cutting down || Rm18 for 2 meals a day, in kl is considered really cheap. So don’t beat yourself up about that. If anything, spend rm2-5 more to get some fruits into your system. 

If the rental house allows u to cook, and if it has some pots n pans, you can learn to cook some simple pasta. 

Pesto Penne is easiest. Boil the pasta for about 7-8 mins, drain then mix in 2 spoons of bottled pesto. You’re set. Pasta is about rm7 a box. Pesto sauce I think is rm20. Can get about 8 servings out of the pesto sauce bottle, with lots of pasta left in the box for next round. 

Other than that, don’t think u can cut out much else unless u become social outcast and just stay at home (not recommended). You’re on your first steps of adulthood, so current earnings aren’t exactly going to help you.

Rm100 for toiletries, seems a bit much haha. I don’t use cologne so maybe mine is cheaper. || You don't eat lunch? || Well nothing much to cut down from your monthly budget except food expense. You also have justified your spending on the toiletries. Im surprised you only spend RM 20 for your phone prepaid. 

From my own experience, cooking homecook meal can be really hassle especially if you cook Malay dishes (need alot of aromatic ingredients & spices).  Then after that you need to clean up the kitchen space. Not really worth it if you cook in small batches. During my early years of working & living away from my parent, i had done this to reduce my food expenses.

I do cook at home but it really 'basic', more of 'slicing & assemble' the food. The only more 'complex' things i do was cooking rice using a rice cooker & boiling eggs using electric multi cooker.

I will boil the eggs in large batches (4-6 pcs) at a times & keep it in the fridge. My diet was basically fruit, vegetables that can be eaten raw (cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes etc), boiled egg, bread (sandwich), rice & oat.

In the morning i usually eat oat with fruit or egg mayo sandwich as breakfast. Both was really easy to make. For oat meal i just need to add hot water &  diced fruit on top of it. Then for the sandwich, i mash the hard boiled egg & mix it with mayo. Slicing some vege & assemble both of it with bread as sandwich. 

During weekend i cook a rice & eat it with boiled egg & raw vege as Ulam with sambal tumbuk for lunch. Sometimes i will buy lauk (chicken, meat or fish) from the restaurant with kuah kosong. Then i cook rice at home & sliced the vege for Ulam. Oh i forget to mention, i usually buy 50sen of ice cube from local grocery store almost everyday & make large batch of sweet ice lime tea (teh O ais limau) that last me for a whole day. Maybe the sweet ice lime tea that keep me going because i usually eat a lite lunch or sometimes skip the lunch.

But the most saving came from free 'dinner'. I usually go to local masjid for maghrib & isyak prayer. People usually donated food especially for majlis tahlil & during malam jumaat (bacaan yasin). If there no donated food for the day, i will eat oat with diced fruit for quick dinner. Actually going to masjid also help you built relationship with local community. Those masjid congregation was really a decent people. They will sincerely help you if you got any trouble. Having a support group like that while staying far away from your parent & families was really a bless.

My diet might be boring but i manage to survive on that. Definitely not for everyone to follow because not everybody can eat almost the same basic food everyday. Hope the best for you as now the food price not as cheap as before. Even egg price was damn expensive now. || Learn to cook || Masak at home can be mahal or murah depending on what sort of food you cook. If you can eat the same thing a few days in a row then you can save quite a bit. Like i usually meal prep for 5 days terus but im the type tak kisah makan the same thing repeatedly. But if you like your variety then having to cook different lauk everyday for one person portion macam not so jimat. || Alright will do! Thank youu || The toiletries part is the max i prepared for it, like premium pocket tissues, yg tebal and quite pricy (because of my sinus, tisu biasa takleh nanti makin gatal hidung hahaha), antacids stock (gastric), deodorant (buy in bulk ofcourse), pimple patch and things i mentioned above. || Yeah might spend a lil bit more for fruits.

Yeah they let me cook, i'll try doing the pasta recipe.

"FoodPanda Malaysia has gotten to a new low. Where got free delivery?  With panda pro you get free delivery with any order RM25 and above. If you dont have panda pro, KFC probably gives free delivery on its own. Usually the restaurant would have a pink message up top stating how much you need to pay before you can get a free delivery (its usually 25 or 30 ringgit). Make sure to update your app to ensure the message appears

Btw do note the free delivery ONLY applies to delivery fees, restaurant can still charge extra fees. || It's a bait tag, they state free delivery on alot of shops but u need Panda Pro to actually use it. And the shit thing is, even with Panda Pro there is still minimum spend in order to get free delivery. || I think the bigger news for me is that KFC has become as expensive as Nando's quarter chicken set used to be, 6 years back.

"[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Quality is much better, tak buat cincai & cheaper thanks to them staying away from the expensive lease rate at the bazaar site. || [deleted] || I missed the old RM 1 3 pcs kuih price. || Went balik kampung and on the way stopped at Kuala Selangor bazar.

"Uncultured Grabfood & Foodpanda riders. Some of y'all really need to be restricted from any forms of access to a motorcycle. You got lives at home to feed but what about other lives on the road be it car drivers/pedestrians? 

Since March 2020, some of y'all been:

1. Breaching red traffic lights and when honked, there you go flashing that middle finger of yours or looking at me as if its perfectly normal.

2. Riding at least 80km/h over zebra crossings at schools with students around. School freakin students. Are you that of a degenerate? Schools reopened, yall dont own the road like you used to. 


It doesn't just happen in only 1 particular state. The nature of my work require constant travel and I'm sick of the risk that I have to anticipate on a weekly basis. I have a Chinese friend who looks Malay with an English name common to Both races. Whoever he orders non-halal food, without even asking for clarification, he’s had riders preach and scold him for being unfaithful bla bla. He got pissed to actually say “f* God” and dare them to report him to Jakim. Nothing came of it luckily but damn annoying || Can I also bring up the other type of uncultured nonsense where some busybody riders would hassle malay-looking customers if they ordered non-halal stuff? || I ride a big bike and I don't think it's limited to food delivery riders. There's lots of caveman motorcyclists on the roads.

After coming back from a round-the-Peninsular 2,500km bike trip, I've reached a similar conclusion that I did from travelling in other countries: people are just nastier in bigger cities.

Road manners were so much better in the countryside and the people I managed to converse with were much friendlier and kinder. Living in close proximity with lots of people stresses the animal side of our brains, I guess. || You forgotten the rempit menace turned into employed riders. I for one am happy these guys are now working rather than taking drugs || It's amazing to see how people giving bullshit reason to justified these reckless riders. Hey, you have job to do doesn't mean you can just endagering others.

I wonder will you say the same thing if one day it was one of yours family member got hit by these reckless riders. || These dudes really need to be more careful. Many times in my own residential area they’ll shoot out at junctions without looking at the main road. I’m not even going fast, maybe 20-30 km, and they can still nearly hit me. Then they have the gall to flip me off too. 

Half the time I see them looking at their phones. I mean c’mon la, I know you need to work, but do so safely. Check your phone at the side of the road and when you’re stationary. If you get hurt after you hit me, I’m the one in the wrong as usual too. || This literally happened to me yesterday, Grab Rider with passenger sped through a red light as I was slowly lurching forward, If I moved any faster for sure collide || One time I ordered from FP, like my house is 40-45min from the town so I don’t mind getting it even if it passed an hour. The rider complaint why my house is so far away. What am I supposed to say… I shouldn’t use your services or something… || Driving on pavement is also quite a norm, I'm walking on pavement also have to be extremely careful for any motorcycles coming from behind. || comments dont seem to understand, OP isnt the only one having issues.I never use any sort of food delivery service like this. If i order take away, its only from restaurants that have their own like mcdonalds.

foodpanda/grab add at least rm 10 on top of what you order for example. If just 1 guy order, thats crazy expensive.

The drivers drive like crazy. Whether i drive or walk, they are a menace. They park blocking cars even when theres a large pavement or motorcycle dedicated spots with space right next by.

They drive on large pavements, often almost hitting me many times when i walk.

ANd ofcourse when they beat red lights and get hit, it causes delays for everyone else, and they dont even have to pay for the damage they cause.

They will drive the wrong side of the road even on narrow one way roads, or even highways. A few times i've had to dodge an incoming biker on an exit going the wrong way even when there is an exit path leading the direction that the biker wants very easily.

They can run over people and still not have to pay anything (malaysian law favours motorcyclists). If you dont want mat rempits in the first place, both the law and police are needed, but police dont even care if bikers drive like mad, as they themselves dont even drive properly.

While there is a time limit, its common sense to add 50% on top of what google maps says. time limit is usually there for accepting not delivery as i've heard 2 hour arrivals for deliveries."
"A Rant About The Panda of Food. I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

[Here's a screenshot for half the conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/279456085885321216/927448327304400966/InkedILLITERATE_LI.jpg). I feel right stupid having this much patience.

I literally got this same email more than 7 times now. It's all the same copy pasted garble cock but from differently named bots. This is beyond infuriating for something so stupidly simple.

Do people still use Panda Mart still...? Or do you guys just use FoodPanda for... well, food?

I know I risk this post not being worthy or relevant to Malaysia or r/Malaysia but holy shit did I need an outlet. I am sorry. About a month ago I tried FoodPanda. Came 2.5hrs later. No way of cancelling cos the whole app couldn’t even load the Help Centre. The food arrived with a receipt saying to prep food by when, so I know it had sat for an hour and a half. In between, estimated time kept changing and a rider was assigned 1hr before it was delivered. Rider went around the world but not collect my food. When I ask the rider, he said he immediately went to the store to pickup when receiving the request. 

Deleted it after that. Ordered in my office so my colleagues knew. And just recently, one colleague experienced status being delivered but food didn’t arrive. Went thru a few rounds of Helpdesk to finally get a refund. She sighed and said should have deleted it when it happened to me. 

I don’t usually like to outright say boycott something, but Panda is definitely something never to use unless ur life depends on it. || I've given up on using foodpanda. I've only ever used their service twice and both times they made me wait an hour for my delivery before canceling.

""Hi Customer, it's too bad but what made sure to wait till 9pm to tell you that we will not be taking you order. Good Luck and try not to starve.""

fucking dogshit indie company Rito games. Sorry, force of habit. || last time i remember, some foodpanda guy put a food in front of my house, i checked it and it's not ours. no one order foodpanda. and i put it there (outside because my sister say so) until 8 pm when my parent is back home. ask my parent who is this food for? they also dont know. at least tomorrow the person who order it get what they want. damn || nowadays, i only use FP to view the restaurant menu.

![gif](giphy|bC9czlgCMtw4cj8RgH|downsized) || I have made it my new years resolution to quit using any e hailing services like Grab, and Foodpanda. Especially for getting food.

The amount i spent on Grab alone is ridiculous. || I can't speak for PandaMart (I don't really dare try this tbh) but the last few times I tried Foodpanda (which was some time ago - because I've stopped) yielded pretty poor experiences. In some cases it's stuff like wrong orders which may be the restaurant's fault (but it doesn't explain why I'm getting these issues way more often with Foodpanda than other services), but in some cases they just don't refund wrong/missing orders despite following through with all their processes. || I had bad experience with food panda also. Especially address part where it keep autocorrect even if I manually input my address. This cause driver to deliver to wrong place and problem cause etc. After that, I no longer use it coz of the address issues and discontinues after using grab food || My gf insists on using FoodPanda when she orders and it's always bad. The time estimates don't make sense, you never know where dlthe driver is and things generally take forever. 

I use Grab and it's usually good, and if something (rarely) goes wrong I get vouchers. || I guess they were only really useful during the *Panda*-mic.

*gets booed offstage* || Yes, they are quite bad. with foodpanda and these delivery apps I started to only use cash as my payment method. If my order is wrong or it doesn't arrive but marked as arrived, i just don't pay and don't need to worry about my money or go through the brain rot of a customer service.

Also, for ordering food, a good tip is to look up these restaurant on google, some of them have their own delivery system that is cheaper or you can contact them and get it delivered through lalamove (I do this for orders from arabic restaurants mostly)."
"Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please! 

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions 1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US)

But they have not been updating hazards recently like the recent floods...

Unfortunately there is not a single better alternative app at the moment. But you can try Google Maps.

You should look into where the closest clinics and hospitals are, in case anything happens. || Can only guess you're in Taylor's, Monash or Sunway U. Therefore:

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

You might find the night life there pleasing. || It's not difficult to go out and explore your surroundings on your own. That is how to learn more about any country you're in and the people.  

Don't expect everyone to spoon feed you information.  

Like another person mentioned, another way is to ask your other international classmates. || 1) speedmart, mydin as your initial ones, then check other big and small. For instance each have their advantage and disadvantage comparing big and small stores. For instance i found that the cheapest sliced cheese cost less at a local shop than bake with yen.  
2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat. I kept it simple, inexpensive and healthy so this saved time. || Dont eat seafood at local mamak tho, the price enter another realm aka kayangan. || You make it seem like we don't live in pandemic times..."
"Tipping culture in Malaysia. Share your story/experience :D I know tipping is not a huge culture here in Malaysia. But have any of you tipped before? And what's your experience like?

For me, I rarely tip, but I do when I feel like that person deserves it. Imo, the service industry in Msia is tough, earning low wages and having to keep up with demanding and sometimes rude customers.

So whenever I see a waiter who gets out of their way to make my experience great, or even that Foodpanda rider who went through bad weather to deliver my food with a smile. I usually tip em.

It always make me happy to see their surprised face when getting tipped, I want them to know that they did an outstanding job and I hope that this small tip would make their day.

Now, onto your story! 

*I usually tip between RM 2 - 10. Tipping when you find the person has an excellence service is ok but god forbid,don't ever adopt usa's stupid tipping culture when you HAVE to tip no matter what. Hell, if your party has 6 or more, the tip is automatically 30%! || I have tipped drivers/ waiters/ grass cutters/ car washers/ etc.. not usually, but when i feel they deserve it for charging too low. || I tip grabfood/foodpanda riders if they delivered in rain, or if its a Muslim rider delivering non-halal food coz I appreciate that not all would do so. Not much la rm2-5 only.

Slightly off topic, but I think we can and should treat workers/cleaners/guards well. At the very minimum, I think you should be courteous to them. One thing I've learnt from the Harry Potter books is that it's not how you treat your peers and your superiors, but how you treat those 'inferior' to you that really says a lot about you. So.... To bring it back to the topic, I think tipping often doesn't take much but it can go a long way for someone, and hopefully make their day. || [deleted] || once I worked as a waiter on second day of CNY during my semester break, a couple tipped me RM50 for working during CNY (even though I actually couldn’t take off lol) . Made my entire week || I normally tip Grab food riders. As someone who orders fairly frequently from Grab, their drivers are courteous (apologize for being late or or a simple but pleasant ""Have a nice day!/Enjoy your food!""). I usually tip RM2 or RM3 ( I give cash), but there was one time when it was raining cats and dogs, and the poor rider was completely drenched and still apologized profusely for being 10 minutes late. I felt so sorry for him that I gave him RM10. Definitely worth it though. As much as I loved my Korean fried chicken, I wasn't going to drive all the way in that weather to buy some. || my mom usually tips hotel workers like those people who carry bags for you to your room || Does simpan baki duit consdier tipping? || If the service has been exceptional, a tip is a nice gesture. 

I disagree though with the western culture that tipping is essential. While I understand they don’t get paid a living wage and rely heavily on tips to go by, providing service and expecting a tip brings about potentially many unwelcomed incidents. || I do a lot, not sure if it’s considered tipping, but when I went to buy at stalls or pasar malam, I always ask them to keep the change if it’s less than RM1. Not doing it cuz I wanna tip but I like to save them the hassle of digging in the cup of coins especially when there’s a lot of customers.

Even though it’s just a little $ but it kinda gives me some satisfaction every time when I see em surprised and happy."
"Foodpanda apologises over ‘hidden’ fees imposed on merchants  It's too late. They've burned the bridges for many, me included. Only when the govt takes notice, they pick up their slack. They have zero relationship with merchants, not a single account manager will pick up your calls or answer your queries. As much as I hate to say it, Grab is much much better in handling complaints. || That was fast || Will they facking fix the MYR5.00 delivery fee for distance as low as 2km? || [deleted] || Just use grab. Always have discount and the delivery fee isnt absurd || They're an example where ""it is easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission"" and then realise that online shoppers are far less forgiving. || It's not a bug, it's a feature. They do it based on time of day and locality. || How else are you going to pay the riders? || Shopee Food has lots of voucher now || HOTDEALS ftw"
"Foodpanda, Grab given 2 weeks to submit comprehensive policy: Nanta  It's great that many of us are willing to take this at face value. I however have an alternate theory to peddle: over the last 8 months this government has never stepped up to help the rakyat willingly. This looks more like a shakedown. Read into it what you will. || The only reason why they can grow and become so big is because they can outsource most of the ethics related problem to others lol.

This is basically the reason why they can be disruptive. Traditional taxis have high rates and less than ideal service at times, but they have to in order to pay a living wage to each and every driver and their car.

Services like Uber and Grab, outsourced these cost to the drivers themselves. Now instead of paying to provide a vehicle, a safety net if business isn't good, etc, everything is outsourced to the employee. 

Basically, think of you're working for a tech company, buy you have to bring your own laptop, pay for your own electricity, and pay for the licensing fee for all the applications that are used out of your pocket. || Not what you think. There’s more to the struggle his ministry is facing. The ministry basically has no ammo earlier on to tackle these giants. They would probably still fail but the compensation would be somewhat a compromise. || >Basically, think of you're working for a tech company, buy you have to bring your own laptop, pay for your own electricity, and pay for the licensing fee for all the applications that are used out of your pocket.

Thats a very good analogy, and very sad to hear it.. || How is ride-hailing relevant to food delivery (i.e. the article)? Also, are ride-hailing drivers not making a living wage? If anything I think the general sentiment is that they are much more comfortable that a good majority of salaried workers making 2k per month. 

I personally feel like ride-hailing was a net good to the society at large. || >Now instead of paying to provide a vehicle, a safety net if business isn't good, etc, everything is outsourced to the employee.

Grab drivers are not employees. They are contractors. || But isn't that what freelancers do? If I was engaging a freelancer, you cannot be expecting me to provide the computers, stationery, etc would you?

And, isn't that what Grab and Food Panda drivers)riders are? They're freelancers, no? || Because it falls into the same business model.

You're providing a service of delivery (think McDelivery) at the same time you are outsourcing all of the cost associated with the service to your ""employees"".

The ""pay"" only looks good when you take into account that you are not getting anything into your EPF or any other benefits, and you are expected to bear the cost of everything yourself. Like I said in my analogy of a tech company, the data plan, mobile phone, vehicle, and fuel cost are all expected to be borne by yourself.

If your bike needs servicing, tayar pamcit because you ran over a pothole, oh and you get injured because of that? In a ""normal"" company, you'd be compensated in some ways, either fully or partially. In the ""privilege"" of working with these companies? Haha your problem la, doctor bill? your problem la. Income? your problem la, where got medical leave? Repair bill for your vehicle? Your bike, your problem la. Your phone fell on the road and broke? Your problem la.

See the problem here?

Even in some of the lower end chinaman company, people have the bare minimum shit like a company phone or some sort or bare minimum compensation to make sure the employees doesn't bear every cost and hazards of the job themselves.

That's why I'll never see them as anything ""good"" aside from normalizing a trend of outsourcing the cost of operation to the employees to maximize margin.

We used to complain that the company ask if we have our own car and is comfortable travelling, complain that the compensation is tak cukup for the work (ie travel petrol cost RM 50 but claim only maximum RM 20). Now we're praising and glorifying a company that literally says ""bring your own tools, pay for our cost of operation, pay for any work hazards yourself"" as if they are saviour of humanity today. || Yes but you dont get penalized if you decide not to work for a month. Grab on the other hand has a system that penalizes ""freelancers"" who has been inactive for a while. || Yes I believe so, and I don’t mind whatever they’re doing but I quote the article and agree if they could provide better understanding to all their riders (by having standard policy that’s being agreed by all parties involved , that’s even better.

>“The three matters are a clear and orderly communication plan from the company to traders, consumers, and riders; a clear application system that does not confuse traders and consumers, as well as a policy on delivery charges, commissions, and payment of wages,” he said in a statement today."
"Proposing a community food delivery service With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment! Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/

"A foodpanda rider got mad at my friend, because he ordered Mcd Fried Chicken. Apparently the rider had to wait as the restaurant was still cooking the chicken. He even gave my friend some sound advice; ""Don't order fried chicken next time"".

But Im not talking about the work, i am talking about the individual as a person, how he treats others based on the circumstance. There are people who don't understand cause and effect. The fault is in McD or perhaps Foodpanda for not making exceptions for cases like this - definitely not your friend's ordering the chicken. Unfortunately this is commonly seen in the workplace.

You must have came across numerous Foodpanda account listings on Shopee, Lazada and others.

Some sellers price their services high, but there're still some who sell at a low price.

**But why pay, when you can do it yourself?**

&#x200B;

**Note: I contacted the Foodpanda technical team long time ago regarding this \[Invite Friends\] bug. But they straight ignored my message and emails. Perhaps they have earned enough money already by** **~~scamming~~** **refunds?**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Basically, this bug is like inviting yourself to the system. Getting both welcome and referral reward vouchers altogether.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**What kinds of vouchers will this net you?**

**You'll get two vouchers:**

* **First-order: RM 10 discount off ( Min. spend RM 20 excl. delivery and service fees )**
* **Second-order: RM 10 discount off ( same requirement as the first voucher )**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Steps on how to get infinite discount:**

1. **If you have registered a Foodpanda account previously with your phone number written. You must log in to the account and change the phone number.**
   1. Just change it to random phone number like 016-999-999
2. Create a new account on Foodpanda
3. After you have reached the page where it asks for your phone number. Just click  ❌ on the top-right of your screen.
4. Then the account will be successfully created without a phone number.
5. Now. Click \[ Invite Friends \] from the options panel.
6. Tap your referral link once to copy the link automatically.
7. Go to your phone's browser and paste the referral link.
8. **In this step, your browser should redirect you to the Foodpanda app automatically**
9. **Try other browsers if you have an issue with automatic redirection.**
10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**
* **The voucher expiry date is 1 month from the claim date.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Bug no longer works \] | They patched it on Feb**

* **See more details on the top of this post.** Your ""Please don't scam your local businesses!"" warning post sure sounds like an instruction manual.

Regardless - please don't scam your local food shops. They bore the brunt of low business during lockdown. || [deleted] || Update: I think I should have clarified something before posting.

I don't encourage anyone to abuse this bug.

"[MalayMail] Foodpanda delivery rider dies in collision in N.Sembilan | Malaysia  This is a rather unfortunate news. 

Although this was bound to happen due to how the riders ride. Delivery incentives by food delivery companies should be amended to not reflect delivery time as the such a heavily weighted contribution to their income. 

If anything, it should be more of a delivery within time and you're good, deliver it earlier than time, you get a fixed bonus. Then you will need a cooldown for the timer of the last order to lapse in order to receive a new order for pick-up. This way riders should ride safe and don't have the incentive to speed that much.

I am hoping that Anthony Loke can do something about this, as he has a good track-record on implementing laws that keep people safe. In my opinion, this won't be just a lack of enforcement issue, because if the incentives of speeding is there, the riders would speed nonetheless, and the coverage area is too wide for enforcement. || Takziah dan Al Fatihah kepada keluarga Allahyarham. || Nowadays riders like to not obey traffic lights.

Any sort of bonuses that involves early timings should not be allowed. || I think you honestly meant your question, so will try to answer rather than modding you down.

Food/courier riders are known to often ride dangerously and often breaks the law. They are often a danger to themselves and the general public. There may be a systemic cause for this behaviour if this is the norm rather than the exception.

Putting the death of this rider into the news hopefully   pulls this topic into the public discourse. If enough attention is given, eventually public servants are pressured to take action and do something about it.

A different example is accidents involving drunk drivers. By exposing more of these incidents into the news, this enters public discourse and the police and transport are pressured to take action. There were news earlier about the police going to conduct more stops and checks for drunk drivers. Whether this be effective to pressure the drinking public to behave better and opt not to drive remains to be seen but this is a start.

Hope this helps! || Because people love pushing narratives thru social media.

This guy is deemed ""riding dangerously"" even before police completed their investigation, because he is a food delivery person."

I think the fella don't even bother to look at the door no he was supposed to deliver to. I msg him and the idiot still very arrogant say he has delivered the food to the unit left from the lift (which is not my unit) and don't even apologize. If he has talk nicely, i would let it go. So i go to look around at other units and luckily found the food hanging there and got it bad. I told GRAB i didn't receive the food (which is true since the rider delivered to wrong house) and got my money back from GRAB. Definitely the rider would be penalized for this. Serves him right. Dah salah, langsi lagi."
"Calling out businesses using AI images on GrabFood Can't ya'll just take proper real life photos rather than this monstrosity? dahla caj mahal pastu malas nak ambik proper food photos.
 Can be considered false advertising. ""For illustration purpose only"" can only go so far. Can we report a store for false advertising? (I don't use Grab so IDK the features) || The sad thing is, I think most of older people might not even realize it was an AI picture. Heck I just show this picture to my friend (late 20s) and she thought it's a real picture. || If a restaurant doesn't bother putting actual effort into advertising their food, can you trust them to put actual effort into making their food? || This so sohai, taking ""the picture is only for illustration purposes"" to the next level. || This is literally false advertising that is clearly designed to misleading customers.

Taking food photos isn't that hard, even smartphone photos can get the job done. Anything that isn't fake AI crap will work better.

This kind of laziness is why we can't have nice things. If there is one type of photography that cannot be replaced with AI, its product photography. || Agree. Of course la AI gonna look good and shi but I wanna know how my food looks like before I order it. Not gonna expect it looks 100% like the photo but atleast it's real photo. || Thank you for sharing. I'll boycott this kind of business. Using AI picture of products = couldn't be bothered about their products. If they are not bothered about what they sell, why should I? || I ordered from this place (not using AI photos) that showed dumplings fried or rather grilled the proper ""pot-sticker"" way.. .. when the food arrived it looked like someone used their hands to squeeze the dumpling smaller than threw it into a deep fryer.. thing was like hard and dry.. 

I put it in the review and the seller say ""Dear, (OMG SHUT UP WITH THE DEAR) picture for showing only"" 

I mean sure, but you are selling Chinese cuisine, what fucking region makes dumplings like this. || You should visit KLIA, most of the ads there now use AI generated images. It's so bad. || Even my local foodcourt stalls at Cheras have those AI food pictures. What you see in the photos are very different with what are served on the table.  I once pointed out the dish and the picture at the stall. The boss just make a 😏 face, and say ""it's like that la, boss"""
"Grab scam with buy one free one combo.   Oh, this buy one free one thing that got me confused at first. I later learned you need to select from their buy one free one menu.

I chose form that said selected ones || just curious but you paid for it without realizing the additional rm10?

you sure is grab scam or the seller scam || If it has,  it is not stated clearly. Example their 15% off cap rm 3 is stated clearly.  || Rm 10? For additional packaging?

"ghost kitchens on grab So just now while searching grabfood for dinner, I came upon multiple different restaurants serving the same exact food as pop meals, was wondering what other restaurants are ghost kitchens. If I wanted to order pop meals I would have ordered popmeals...  
  
Restaurants that are popmeal ghost kitchens : frydays, pasta&co and Mac & Cheese Bros I also found somebody cooking from their kitchen at home advertising as if they are a restaurant on grab. Complete with their own restaurant logo and professionally taken photos of their menu items.

edit: one night I was super hungry and opened my Foodpanda app to set for Nearest Location to get fast delivery, and discovered that one house in my  area is doing this! I thought itu bukan kedai makan || Google maps first, then go to their grab listing. always. :) || I assume yes because in my area there are so many restaurants I have never heard of but they mostly serve burgers or pasta.. || What’s ghost kitchen? || After trying a no. of ghost kitchens in and around Bangsar, I found only Pasta Roma halfway decent. || I've seen a restaurant on grab use what looks like AI-generated images for their food pics..... || I've seen this happen with Thai restaurants and chicken rice places in my area (OUG). || This is quite common in Jakarta.

The brick and mortar restaurants don't exist and instead, it's 1 central kitchen cooking up dishes for multiple ""restaurants"" in the grab/gojek app. Also, I think the term is central kitchen, not ghost kitchen. I may be wrong though

I gotta say that I love the concept of it.

"Wholesome GrabFood Moment (read caption) Yesterday I ordered GrabFood and requested cutlery as I didn't have any being a guest in a hotel room.

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe... 

 Cutleries should be free, and prices on Grabfood are hiked up rate. || RM1.05 for cutlery wtf

"Grab Account Suspended? My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

Funny thing is, they told her she got outstanding payment but there isn't any guidance on how to pay it, but also her account is suspended so she can't even login to Grab app.

So what's the quickest way to contact Grab support? And how did my mum even got outstanding payment if she only use cash payment on delivery?

The rider also told me to not pick up the CS’ calls because I think he wanted to scam me and said that I didn’t pay.

"GrabFood Now Lets You Avoid Small Order Fees By Purchasing Vouchers - Lowyat.NET  Pay rm4 now and for your next order, you ""Avoid"" the rm2 small order fee!

This is a scam. You're essentially paying those small order fees in this order, for a potential saving on your next order. If your next order isn't small, you're already paying for it.

"Experience with Malaysia's food delivery service Hello all! I would like to know if you guys have a very bad experience or good ones with some of the food delivery services available in your area?

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof. I was already like ""how do I show proof of something I don't have?"". So then I called the customer service line (had to wait 10 mins Btw) and ask for details. The person explains that I needed to take a picture before eating and show all the things I get, which I guess make sense to always check what you received. Still, it's so frustrating to get punished for this. I'm one burger short, hungy, no refund, and angy! 

I've had missing items when ordering from Grabfood but never got any problem with the refund. it's almost always instantly approved. So what about you guys? any horrible ones you had? Even in business, you are expected to inspect your goods ordered when delivered. This is true in all business transaction || Perks of being pandapro member. They never reject or ask for proof of my missing order complaint. Always refund my money.


Edit: we also had sushiking to contact us personally and offer free sushi lol. || Experience with GrabFood

Order came, one item missing in the set. I took photos as evidence, requested a refund. Waited for follow up asking for evidence but realized the refund(the amount of the set, not the price of that item) just get approved (without the need of photos) 

Kinda feel bad. They rugi the whole set just because one missing item.

 But then realized it is KFC. Fxxk KFC anyway for all those tiny chicken 🤣 || my experience is wait half an hour and get order cancelled. || Been using food delivery services and always check if ur items are missing the moment u receive the item not after u makan.

Do u think they will entertain u? || Top tip: Don't use Shopee Food || [deleted] || Don't try this in big season during cny they can't handle it || [deleted] || To be fair, it is difficult to prove that you did not receive the burger since you didn't take any photos upon reception. However I believe the platform does have a ""reputation system"". Maybe if it's your first time complaining then the CS will side with you despite it is your mistake for having insufficient evidence. But for future complains, they can see your records and make judgements from there..im not saying that you're trying to cheat but it's something to think about"
"Menu Price Difference on GrabFood So, recently I noticed that the menu  items of a particular restaurant are different by ~RM3-RM4 on GrabFood compared to their in-store price. The thing is they explicitly mentioned that the prices are same as in-store on their menu page in GrabFood. I did saw a post similar to this in this subreddit. However, can anyone please tell what can be done regarding this? Is there somewhere we can report this? There will always be a difference. Nobody will do a business where they lose money, Grab takes 31.8% off of everything in the menu, so if a restaurant sells for the same price as in store, they will be losing 31.8% of profit plus plastic for takeaway packaging. 

The easiest way is to not use their service unless really really have to. One pandemic and they think they're an unstoppable service/business. Let them think otherwise || Try to use food delivery services only if you’re in desperate situations. Otherwise, do takeaway or dine-in. || https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-my/900004330283-Why-is-the-item-price-different-from-In-store || Platform fee yo. Someone's gotta pay grab for their services. || Easy we protest by not using their service. || I never took these words literally, just a word play to trap customers. Like unlimited data but got 10gb fup. Fast internet, 6mbps. Superfast internet 18mbps.

He’s talking about cases where the price is stated to be same in-store when it’s not.

Situations like this happen because some shops (advised by Grab onboarding team i guess) specifically print a separate menu just for Grab verification purposes. Or specify different prices on their menu just for takeaway/delivery. Or have special bundles just for delivery while not selling individual, cheaper, items.

There are a lot of tricks and loopholes they’re using to get away with displaying “prices are same as in store”. It’s very deceptive. || [deleted] || [deleted] || Nice..somehow missed seeing this...thank youu!"

"Food delivery guys asking for charity money In 4 separate occasions, I had 4 different food delivery guys (Shopeefood and Grabfood) asking me to give them money when they deliver my meals. 

1st time: no money for milk powder for baby, so i gave him some cash out for sympathy

2nd time: father in hospital due to cancer - i didn't give any, cos this one sounds too random and scammy

3rd time: accident - by the third time, confirm it is a collective thing between them to do this? 

4th time: lost wallet or something - like wth??? 

(these are all different delivery guys)

Has anyone experience this? I no longer feel safe ordering when all these delivery fellas keep coming up with scammy excuses to get money from you. Maybe should give them one star and complain to Grab. But yeah I’d feel uncomfortable if they keep asking all that. Might end up stop using the app altogether and just go buy my meal. || They might have ur address white listed OP when you gave money to the first guy, be firm and calmly say no if they do it again. || That’s really suspicious, if it has happened 4 times already. || Maybe it depends on the location.

"Grabfood prices(face to face noodle) So, basically I decided to go buy there instead of using grabfood, then after checking the receipt I realised all the dishes in grabfood are more expensive by another rm3 on the menu, I think not including delivery price. If two noodle then it's an extra rm6 compared to the actual price in the store. Not including delivery price.

The thing is grabfood stated on the store menu that it is in store prices for that shop, and that doesn't mean an extra rm3 for everything is reasonable within range for food. 

So is this something normal I should bear with. Or is it not normal,  how do I report this problem then? I'm new to food delivery, mercy.  I didn't order through grabfood this time, only compared the prices. The thing is Grab imposes a cut of 15-30% from store sales. So the shop have no choice but to raise their prices to cover the margin.

Edit: On the argument that grab that states  ""menu price is same as in-store"". 
Technically yes, shop owner need prove their price by uploading their menu. But here's the catch, it's a separate menu just to raise the margin.
Source: close friend who owns a cafe. || Yep caught a few doing this. Honestly I don't mind if they are upfront that the prices are higher than in-store. However if you claim that you are same in-store price that is  in the wrong. || Bruh they've been doing this since the start of grab food. || Yeap most of the times always cheaper to order food yourself at the store.


However, Grab does offer the convenience of you not needing to transport your food and waiting for your food to be done. || >The thing is grabfood stated on the store menu that it is in store prices for that shop

this is what I know from a few restaurant shop owners. the right procedure is Grab will go to the restaurant and check their restaurant menu, but it has become lenient recently, probably because of lack of manpower || Just to add on, the answer is a bit more nuanced than that. I learnt a bit about the f&b scene after watching a podcast with myburgerlab owner ([link](https://youtu.be/fJBqSqKR8ck?t=2842)), it's a bit long but I highly recommend it.

I'll give a tldr, pre-covid, food delivery commission was alright, even if takeaway food usually have smaller earning than dine-in. When covid hit, food delivery starts to increase commission saying covid hitting their margins, f&b doesnt have negotiation power because otherwise they cant earn during mco. But food delivery app also introduces discount to user, you can imagine how small the margin are left for f&b business. On top of that, ingredient costs are at all time high. The extra rm6 you are paying is for f&b to earn back their margin that gets eaten by app, otherwise the f&b business won't be sustainable. You can imagine how much food delivery app companies are earning as middleman. || Yeah it’s expected because Grab is taking a % cut.     

However, Some stores DO have real in-stores prices if you select “pick up” as the option. And that’s why I like foodpanda more. It has that juicy 15% pickup. 20% if you are a subscriber. Sometimes it’s so cheap it feels like I’m stealing. || don't use food delivery if you can. You pay higher price; the restaurant gets lower profits; you are increasing your single-use plastic usage; you are supporting a system that incentives reckless driving and worker abuse; || That's the way they became billion dollar company. Hence eating up margin is their only way of bussiness. Same like grabcar etc. Literally middle men big brother. But tbh its much more convinience than going to buy yourself. Calculate tge effort, parking, tolls if any, and obviously petrol cost. The best way to save money if u persist is just cooked at home yourself. || Do report, the shop is not being honest."
"What to Expect from a Malaysian Quarantine Centre in KL Hi all! I want to tell you all about my ongoing experience as a Person Under Surveilance (PUS) in Kuala Lumpur. Hopefully this will be useful information of you are travelling home soon. I am a Malaysian Student travelling back from the UK. I arrived in KLIA on 27 July. 

After touchdown in KLIA, we were all given COVID swab tests before being allowed to pass through immigration. After everyone from your flight has done the test and gone through immigration, you will be taken to a hotel to complete your quarantine. The whole process from touchdown to the hotel check in took 6 hours despite there only being around 30 people on my flight. There was a lot of queuing and waiting around, and you are expected to wear a mask and face shield at all times. We were given some refreshments while waiting for the others after immigration but I still suggest you make sure you have your own water and plenty of masks so you can keep yourself comfortable. ***Remember to bring your own pen to fill out any documents and bring a hard-copy of everything, like your flight itinerary, letter of undertaking, approval letter to return to Malaysia, etc.

Everyone from my flight was checked into the Holiday Inn Express in KLCC. The room was immaculately clean, ensuite, lots of water and toilet paper provided, but unfortunately the windows do not open so no fresh air. There is a desk in the room too so it is definitely quite comfortable for one person to stay here alone but I couldn't imagine being cooped up here with someone else. 

Food is delivered 3 times a day within a certain time frame but they are often late. My hotel does not accommodate to dietery requirements such as vegetarian or vegan, and everyone is expected to eat rice, curry and chicken. You can order special meals at an extra charge and these will be delivered to your room instead of the standard fare. As a Malaysian with no special dietery requirements however, I think the food so far has been delicious even though it is usually cold by the time it is delivered to me. 

The system for ordering meals and extra ameneties such as coffee, sugar, tea or water is very disorganised and conducted entirely through whatsapp. Ringing the reception does not guarantee you an immediate response and they will usually only deliver your requested items with your next mealtime. No outside food and drink is allowed to be delivered to the hotel and of course all PUSs are not allowed to leave their room, not even wander the corridor. ***the hotel is trying to accommodate vegetarians but from what I’ve heard through the WhatsApp group, it’s not the best but at least they are trying. 

There is an intercom system with speakers installed in every room. The speaker's are very loud and there is no escaping it, the hotel management will announce warnings and reminders to stay in our rooms and threaten us with repercussions. It gets very annoying, especially when they are announcing it at 8am in the morning in multiple languages. 

Here are the things I suggest you pack with you for comfort during your quarantine: 
1. Metal utensils to eat with (only plastic utensils are provided by the hotel)
2. Your own shampoo and conditioner (the hotel only provides all-in-one soap)
3. A data plan for your own internet connection (the hotel wifi is very slow and a lot of people had trouble connecting to it. I wouldn't depend on it)
4. Snacks and condiments (you can technically order dry snacks via GrabFood or smth but I wouldn't depend on the hotel staff to bring it up to you in good time. No condiments provided with your food.) 
5. Cup noodles (in case you get bored of the standard meals)
6. Protein powder (meals are very carb heavy. Bad for gains)


***Update; 29 July: The fire alarm went off today which caused concern among the guests. Hotel management told us to stay in our rooms while they investigated the cause of the alarm. Turns out someone was smoking in their room. I pity them as they cannot go outside to smoke and it must really be killing them to have to endure this for 2 weeks. 

***1 August: Given a wristband and safety kit consisting of masks, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. I’ll be given another swab test on the 10th day and can go home if I it is negative. 

***I will keep updating this post with more information as it comes. I still have 12 days left in my quarantine.*** 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AT THE HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS. THERE ARE OTHER QUARANTINE CENTRES IN KL WHICH MAY PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE AND AMENITIES. I have a few questions:

1. If you packed food with you in your luggage (e.g instant noodles, snacks etc) from your departing country, would they confiscate it? Coz since you say you need to pay extra for food and the ordering system is disorganised, maybe bringing some extra food over would help a little.
2. Do the hotel staff come in to the room, to clean it for example?
3. I know it's only day 2 for you, but how have you been keeping yourself entertained so far? What's your plan for the next 12 days? || Last time they were allowed to order foodpanda/grab or even shoppee lazada. Parents can drop clean cloth n stuff needed. Have you tried ask the person in charge there? (KKM?) || Any pics of food, the place, etc? || I want to know what is the pricing policy now as a Malaysian? How much do you need to pay, if any? || You mentioned a data plan and snacks. Do the authorities let you purchase these at the airport first before being quarantined? Assuming you're returning from overseas with an expired Malaysian SIM, hence no data plan, and you need to buy one. || Interesting.

We went through the same experience in both Auckland, New Zealand in March and then Melbourne, Australia in June. || Do they conduct any test on you so far? || Thanks for sharing! This is incredibly insightful for any returning Malaysian. What sort of documents or forms were you required to fill out prior to departure by the way? 

Glad to hear you got home safe though! Hope you aren't too dead bored in the centre. Keep us posted OP! || Seriously? I was lucky enough to come back during the period when I was allowed to stay at home for quarantine and only required to take another test after 14-days. Without paying a single cent. || Hi, just wondering when you go through immigration, what kind of questions did they ask you?"

We are really disappointed and upset with the partnership with [**GrabFood**](https://www.facebook.com/GrabFoodMY/?__cft__[0]=AZX_4fh1IxKeGTQrsOCKR1k_MldU08svr_dQGnF9WaDQb8An2YI7dPrNKn5ecSzgbh4715QEpuH6CyScPfG9l58aQZMYW5JDBd5MyPuNeRUcTcU6hnKRajLCYlmopNtRA3yqtYpxBe4y-ySR7qOwgQKKyovWMLK65_m6NNfP4A4P-g&__tn__=kK-R). 

We have been on-boarded to GrabFood for more than a year now, and we have been a cooperating partner.   
Not until recently that we found out GrabFood has been very non-transparent in their assignation for restaurants availability in terms of radius. 

We have been receiving a lot of complaints from our customers about GrabFood not showing the availability to deliver within reasonable distance, and we thought this is due to GrabFood system that is set to be within a specific distance in each area. However what triggered the following case was on 26 May 2020, when we were alerted by our staff that GrabFood was unavailable for that day (imagine the sales that we lost, especially during this COVID period whereby businesses are struggling). Our sales from GrabFood on that day is ZERO. Upon checking, we realized other restaurants in same area is available but not us.

Hence we reached out to GrabFood merchant support via live chat and given the response that they off our restaurant availability from the back-end due to differences in commission rate by different restaurants, which means the restaurants which signed higher commission rate with them will get the priority and 'be available in more places'. And they switched on our availability back after our call.

We were very upset and escalated to the manager. He then gave us another explanation that GrabFood will allow restaurants with larger 'sales bucket' to appear in more places. If that's the case, it's discrimination against small businesses, or any businesses that have menu selling items with lower price.  
We gave feedback to them that this is not acceptable. And the manager promised to get back to us again after discussing with the team. It's been a week and we hear nothing from them.

Yet it happened again today..! We realized they 'turned off' our restaurant again after checking from the app. Hence we wrote a complaint again, and same cycle happened... (same canned response, and they switched back on)

We are deeply disappointed with such partnership relationship. Does this mean that we have to always check if our restaurant has been hidden from the platform? These occurrences have broken the trust, we don't know when their system will discriminate against us again and only switch back on after we found out and reach out to them each time. This is totally unfair to small and medium businesses. || Interesting, maybe this is why sometimes I see some restaurants in the same area being ""Unavailable for delivery"" despite being well within the riding distance, while others in the vicinity operate just fine. || Precisely why I don’t use these food delivery if I got the option. Their outreach into various industries for e-hailing, e-wallet and food delivery and the subsequent monopoly of the industry is extremely unsettling. || Time to switch to foodpanda? || 'Support your local heroes... who are willing to pay us more' || Capitalism at its finest... pretty shit of grabfood || Grab and Foodpanda charges around 30% commission, which has to be borne solely by the restaurants because they are prohibited from marking up their prices. If you sell your burger for RM10 on your menu, you can't change the price to RM13 on foodpanda to cover the commission. In an industry where profit margin is already thin, being on these platforms are not as great as it's hyped up to be. They're not there to help your business, they're there to help themselves. Fp and grab can suck it. 

If you want to support local businesses (as you should!), order takeaways or ask if they themselves can deliver. We did this during Ramadhan and we didn't even charge any delivery fee, and many local restaurants do the same. Support them directly! || [deleted] || Yeah. Was kind of expecting some shit like this to start happening already. For the most part, this is something that I expected “platforms” in the “sharing economy” to pull, sooner or later. It was one of the reason why I was so reluctant to get on Grab and their ilk, and only did it recently when I noticed the value of not having to rely on having cash to pay, and the fact that delivery was basically how we all stayed alive during the MCO.

So I do use these apps, but otherwise I try to reduce usage as much as I can. But yeah. Good to see that people are starting to realize what kind of shitty position you'll be put in when you start trusting these platforms. They want to maneuver you into a position where they become the sole buyer or seller of these services, and *then* the real hurting starts.

Incidentally: if you think that stopping the use of this platform and going to `$COMPETITOR` is going to make things better? It won't, if the competitor is another profit-making corporation. You're still going to get fucked over, it's just a matter of when.

It might be useful to see whether stuff like [platform cooperatives](https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad), where the platform is run and operated by the people who're doing the work, rather than some other entity skimming off the profits, might be something that Malaysians can come together with and bring up.

ETA: goddamn it, why did I paste my entire message twice? Anyway, fixed. || Hmm, I stay in subang and never saw burgertory available or on the main pages during mco. Many were listed as unavailable during times where it should be open as well"
"E-Tunai Rakyat: A primer You may have read the announcement that the government has [selected Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets are selected for the e-Tunai Rakyat initiative.](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tng-boost-grab-selected-etunai-rakyat-initiative)

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

Source: [ Touch 'n Go FAQ,](https://www.tngdigital.com.my/etunairakyat) 

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities. "" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong. ""

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)
I don't use grabpay because there's no incentive for me to do so. || Thanks for sharing this post OP ! || i earn more than 100k a year. would the ewallet verify with lhdn if i sign up for it in the app? || The only reason I use TnG is for RFID/Pay direct at the toll i go through every day for work. There aren’t many incentives for now but the reload process is almost instant. Have yet to try Boost (didn’t like that I can’t transfer money out of the account - not sure if that’s changed recently) and grabpay doesn’t seem to be accepted everywhere yet. Nice to see we are moving towards a cashless society :) || I use touch n go ewallet on a daily basis because i hardly carry cash anywhere I go. I dont like the idea of withdrawing money at Atm and the most i carry in my wallet is rm5.

My spending habit changed tremendously. I only eat out at a place that accept ewallet/card payment. I only make withdrawals if i decide to go somewhere that will require cash. || Boost reverted policies (changing cashback to coins) really making me wana uninstal the app, but then i got rm10 out of the blue, i mean i had to postpone my thought for now. || Touch and Go presented our company with an additional problem, used to be we blindly allow our sales and service team to claim TNG receipt, now we have them to itemize their spending and restrict it to only toll and parking if they want to use the app (one dude claimed over 1k via TNG, we found out he use the e wallet to makan) || TBH they should just unify TnG card and TnG eWallet. Saves so much trouble. || As I'm a heavy user of RFID/TnG Paydirect, I'll definitely choose TnG e-wallet. Cus who doesn't like free tolls??"
"PSA: Price difference between FoodPanda and GrabFood  This screencap is from today 30/05/2019.

Grabfood may have very attractive subscription plans and promos, but ultimately their price hike is too much. If you have no promo codes, consider comparing prices as Grabfood will most likely be higher (approx 30%). This is consistent across more than three vendors I've personally ordered from so do your research as well. Sometimes even with promo codes, Foodpanda comes out to be cheaper. As Grabfood also commonly have a minimum, consider Foodpanda if you often do take out for one. Don't be blindly attracted by promos, as it's not always cheaper.

If you have a shopback account, Foodpanda is eligible for cash back as well.

If you are used to Grabfood, currently they have a voucher code that is rather good (EasyEats), thanks u/KuzaSasuke for the tip! But once this promo is gone, to Food Panda I will go.

TL;DR: **If you have no vouchers, avoid Grabfood at all cost.** || thats why I prefer standard fast food delivery. || GrabFood's item price is higher than Foodpanda's total. I have never used GrabFood, but from this it looks like I never will. || Would the difference be because of the Brown Sugar Warm Pearls? Or is the foodpanda order truncated? || Didn't know this one drink can cost me a full dinner of KFC for two || Which one provides better service? Never used either one before. || Good to know, thanks for share || Yeahhh grabfood is pricier so I dont prefer them. I use foodpanda more. || Tealive recently increase their pricing on GrabFood for some unknown reason, maybe because of the commission percent set by Grab which cause them to increase the pricing. I always use GrabFood because I also gain Reward point which can be used to buy deals either for GrabCar or other brands. || I tried More Fun once. It was not fun at all, the designated driver ignored their order and just rode home."
"Why McDonald's is partnering with GrabFood when they themselve already have their own 24/7 delivery sercive ? Is there any perks to order McDonald's in Grab rather than McDelivery?

"GrabFood Tips Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Wrong delivery

&#x200B;

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

&#x200B;

* You can get partially refunded for an order that was wrongly fulfilled. Was expecting tips on ordering or using GrabFood but found 2 cases of complaints instead. || r/unethicallifeprotips || My friend cheated by FoodPanda. I Sent voucher(first time user) to friend. Friend use first time user code, but restaurant cancel order because some items not available. However, the first time coupon considered ""used"" and they dont give you a coupon replacement because my friend account considered not first time use anymore!!. Food Panda penipu scammer!!! || Case #1, you can save your dinner. It will be delivered instead of burn at the restaurant.

Case #2, you can get a refund. Many people will just let it slip when it is your right to claim what you ordered. 

Just sharing tips on how to use these apps better || That is not a scam. Other people use the code without issue. It's just an issue, which your friend should take up with FP. || I used GrabFood all the time while at Jakarta, Hanoi and Manila and they do work fine without any issue - the food gets delivered on-time and the right orders. Maybe those places are used to the service culture due to being real tourism-centric cities. Seems like hit-and-miss for different countries or localities. || Already did. Bodoh Food Panda CS says the code already used, no replacement, cant do shit. So yeah, Food Panda penipu scammer.  || Grab and Gojek are a lot better in Indonesia than Malaysia. Grab sucks shit here in comparison. || Wow. Got FoodPanda rider and CS here plotek and downvote me! Lol. Later i give nasty rating in Google Playstore to FoodPanda. Try downvote that!🤣 || Grab Food or Grab or both?"
"My Issues with GrabFood Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)


 Alright || My experience is Grabfood and foodpanda is always always feeling bad for the food delivery guy, especially when it rains.  || It's a stapled-on business line, coz ""synergies"". What do you expect?

I always preferred startups that do one thing and one thing well. Happy with dahmakan if not for their incessant marketing spam. || TLDR,  


Judging by the organization and length of your post, i rate it a 11/10 pissed.

foodpanda is great, man. || Me too. That's why I do not order whenever it rains.  || That’s a crap option. You don’t order the guys don’t get paid.

"Why do I have higher Grab food delivery rates? Why am I seeing higher delivery fees than my friend’s? We are ordering from the same restaurant, we are at the same location (encircled 2.9km away), and we tried it at the same time (so demand/surge/whatever should be same). We both use android phones. We both do not have the Grab Unlimited subscription.

I already tried asking customer support about this, but first the chat was ended by the agent after reading my message, and second the ticket I raised has been stuck there waiting for a response for days already.

I just want to know the reason why.

Only differences between me and my friend that could affect this which I could think of are: 1) I am on the Gold tier while he is on the Member tier, 2) He is local Malaysian. I remember seeing similar news in Singapore a few years ago and there was outrage about it in the Singapore subreddit, just putting my tinfoiled hat on but I think Grab's algorithm differentiates their users based on their spending habits and tiers, higher tiered users or frequent users are probably marked as less price sensitive so they will just mark up the price in hopes that you will stick on using their service and avoid considering alternatives || Did your friend have the annual subscription? || OP I recommend you to repost this to r/Bolehland as well. Try to retitle your post to include the fare difference since many commenters here did not read the description and misunderstood your post, I think about half of the commenters here just assumed that you were complaining about the expensive fees

Also if possible try to combine both images into one to show the price difference side by side to make it easy for people to see the price difference

The post about the price difference went viral in r/Singapore which prompted Grab to give a response 3 years ago, honestly I don't want Grab to get away with this || They charged you more so Tan Chong family get richer || Grab's magical algorithm is supposed to calculate delivery fees based on distance, availability of riders, the business of the restaurant and probably a few other factors I'm not aware of. How any average end user can tell if it's not also programmed for blatant profiteering, we'll probably never know, but I wouldn't put it past them given their history. || Grab Unlimited user here. Only RM5 a month, and 70% of my orders are free delivery most of the time, on top of the price cuts i get everytime i order from a store with Hot Deals tagged. I don't order that frequently, at most once to twice a week. 

As for food panda, haven't touched them in years. || It's all the algorithms, it's not some conspiracy theory. The calculation is based on time, availability of drivers, weather, traffic.. Basically a multitude of data points that change by the minute and effect the calculation... || Same here. I have two grab accounts, the one I often use has Gold tier, the other is just left at home for family members to use. The one with Gold usually shows a slightly higher fee during peak hours. The algorithm probably assumes a frequent user would be willing to overlook a higher fee. Same thing with Foodpanda. || For agoda, i notice constant price difference between my android phone and my wife's iPhone, with the iphone always cheaper.

Not sure phone brand related or because i always book with the wife's phone || I have a similar experience as well with Grab Food and Shopee Food. Same location, restaurant, food, placing the order at the same time, everything is the same including user tier but different delivery fee rates. I would usually compare across the accounts and order from the account with the lowest delivery fees."
"What happened to Pink and Orange box motorbike riders? (Food Panda and Shopee Food) I last time see many of these food deliverers whizzing through the roads, but nowadays I only see Grab's green box riders.

What happened to them? Bad business or not enough workers? Grab is grabbing them by the balls for tying to grab Grabs market share.

Grab || I think they still exist. Just that they have multiple phone, Grab or FoodPanda as main, Shopee Food as sub. || long enough on the road you'll see plenty of them || No more money. Food delivery peak during the pandemic, investors threw money at these businesses. Now, online food delivery stagnated, and some are on a decline. Most of them are bleeding cash. The only reason Grab is dominant is due to their other services supporting their food delivery service. || Got lah. Foodpanda service is actually much faster. Grab is slow as fark. Usually 1 hr delivery. But Shopee Food delivery mainly gone. Because shopee service sucks, if your food is gone...good luck...wait ding dong email for a few weeks.

Foodpanda still has best service with contactable live agents who take action immediately. Grab usually has more discounts options. || I think Grab isn't very good in terms of service, the food becomes cold upon arrival, long waiting time. || I prefer Grab too. FoodPanda is expensive. || Yes...all multi headed agents...like car salesman. Go to Perodua showroom, salesman will tell you he sells Proton too. Go to Proton showroom, salesman tell you he sells Perodua too. Went to Carsome...saleswoman says she sells everything. Including new cars...apa kereta lu mau? || Grab is dominating the market. All food delivery food delivered is cold. || No lah, Shopee food is fast and warm, but they're disappearing dunno why"
"Grab/ShopeeFood riders of reddit, what were your weirdest interactions with people while delivering food?  Not me. But just last week, my brother sent me a call recording of him receiving a call from a customer—asking if my brother wanted a BJ or not.

It's safe to say my brother vows to stop doing this gig once his marriage fund is 100% funded. He's at 90% currently. || Grab food experience: The customer put the wrong address in and started spam-calling me after I redelivered the food saying she wanted to get the police to kill me. Real crazy stuff that day.

Grab Car experience: The customer placed the wrong address and ended up wasting 3 hrs at the police station after she threatened to accuse me of kidnapping and Sexual Assault. Good thing I have a dash cam. Certainly helps me when she insulted the police during the visit. Woman has issues for sure, thinking her part Aussie ass means she could get everything she wanted. || I heard some like to be naked on door waiting for delivery and tease you guys. Anybody encountered this before? Need story from both side. || Gay customer wanna flirt with me sorry la i prefer original honey || Grabcar here. Got one japanese lady shouted that I'm kidnapping her once I accidentally took a wrong turn. I immediately stopped the car in the middle of the road and asked her to get out. All this happened in mont Kiara where there's at least 1000 people out there strolling about.

Called grab support and they also confused why she blamed me of kidnapping her in one of the busiest street. Crazy lady.

From that moment itself I installed internal dashcam with voice recording to defend myself against crazy passengers. || in shopee there is chat for rider. there is also one from restaurant. but the later one is greyed out. so use the rider chat inform which curry and piece to get, to that one guy said nothing to do with him, tell restaurant direct (how?). so you ride there cant tell the restaurant the customer asked for what? very poor customer service.

so a few things can happen. they ignore your request and just do whatever; or they actually do what is asked; or they just straight out say no. lelz...

driver got me curry lentil and fish. the ones people most often don't like x-x; 

someone needs to remind driver, without customer u have no job. so don't behave like this :/ || just hope this won’t happen in MY 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/s/X9XkUFdVXG || I sometimes don’t wear underwear when I pickup my food from the driver . I will stare into his eyes as my balls wiggle about while picking up my food . 

I’m not gay but I tbink it’s thrilling that he doesn’t know my balls are doing the Harlem Shake just few meters from him

Edit : damn , yall really can’t take a joke 😭 || BJ, i straight thinking of black jack… must be the cny atmosphere pressure… || So.... does that mean he accepted the BJ as payment to fund his marriage?"
"GRAB getting worse ☹️ I have been using Grab for YEARS but recently,Ithe service has gone from bad to worse..Delivery charges are ridiculous..Drivers now accept ONLY if ride faress are high..Then they cancel 🙄..Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded..Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours..Food & mart prices are higher than outside market prices..And the choices are so limited..Some drivers are RUDE..It's come to the point,I avoid Grab as much as possible..Also,they accept the rides,then DON'T move till i get so fed up,I cancel 🤬 You can read up on “platform decay” or Enshittification. What you’re describing is baked into the business model - they were never sustainable at low cost, good quality service.

For what it’s worth, I now only use foodpanda for food delivery and take airport limo from airport but for the most part we’re stuck with a monopoly. || I really hate drivers trying to make us cancel instead of them cancelling. They just hang around and not moving. I was not giving up, I used another phone to book a ride, let the first driver wait 2 hours before telling them they lost 2 hours of their lives waiting for me to cancel || BOLT BOLT BOLT, all the older and smarter drivers have switched to Bolt/indrive/maxim. || A few days ago, the fare for pickup from my house was RM60+ and rising. Then I changed the pickup location to the opposite street, my neighbour's, and the fare dropped to RM30+. 

THEIR ALGORITHM PURPOSELY PUT HIGHER PRICE IF PICKUP FROM HOME! || Just look up the distance between your location and your destination, deduct 20% from your total fare and divide it by the KM. That's how much the driver gets per KM. If it's less than RM0.90 - RM1/KM, be prepared to encounter problem like getting stood up. 

Based on my own experience as a part time driver, out of 30 jobs,maybe only 2 or 3 i got RM1 or more/KM. On average it's RM0.70/KM sometimes even RM0.60/KM. That's the reason the service is getting worse. It's proportionate to the price which is super cheap. If you choose Grabcar Plus, it's very rare for this to happen if any because of the higher price. || So far I have good experience for Grab Food but I guess I live in an area where there are a lot of delivery riders. I order a lot of Grab food a month (circa RM700-800) as I get some sort of allowance from company (due to remote work). 

When it comes to Grab ride, sometimes I can see that it is a few drivers which tends to spoil the whole bunch. They started behaving exactly like how taxi drivers were hated upon in the past. They basically became numb to their customers. From driving like hooligans and maniacs to simply blocking traffic and stopping indiscriminately just to drop off a passenger. || I think ppl talked about how Grab started the way they did because of their massive funding, right at the beginning.

Get ppl hooked in their services, by sustaining massive losses.

Now they're just trying to break even. Don't think they're profitable even?

The business model was never a viable one. || They had to start making money 1 day ... can't be making losses forever. || For food I completely agree it has been nothing but downhill. I don't use grab car so can't comment... for airport runs, use the train it comfortable and fast. Around town using mrt. || I *just* started to drive for Grab. I don't think I can turn-off auto-accept, although I don't cancel on anyone (when I get tired, I just go offline and finish my current job).

> Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded

I mean... that's fair, isn't it? 

> Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours

Really?

I never see these ""triple"" fares. I would **love** to get some of that."
"Grab Food Delivery App Anyone notice the search function in the food delivery apps getting worse lately? Literally cannot find anything that I search for and always gives me the same options within 1-2km of me. Every place is closed for delivery and only has pick up options. 
I understand Grab took a larger cut so there’s less drivers on the road… what other apps does everyone use? I’m usually busy working and have no time to run out for food so I have to grab or find something quick for dinner. Looking for some suggestions here. 
 Recently something is very wrong with grab as they have very very few delivery riders now. Ever since raya the amount of orders generated by grab drop from 90 orders a day to 10. Customers called to ask why there is only pick up option thinking that we are closed for delivery. || bekal indriver || I use grab to order everyday, except for the chain stores most other shops show pick up only. Seems like they don't have enough riders || Yes, I keep seeing the pick up only option or “closed”. Not sure if it’s an issue with grab or the restaurant isn’t taking orders. Is it an issue with a lack of drivers? || During raya time up to 90% of their riders are off. It is so drastic they actually send out an email to merchants to apologize for it. || They did anticipate it and recruit more riders 1-2 months before Raya, by recruiting more Malay riders 🗿"
"No grab and food panda on weekends night (KL PUDU)?  Is there some sort of unspoken rule for deliveries on weekend nights? 

We are not local and we noticed a few weekends in a row thst we are never able to order any grab or food panda at night after 10pm, even if the resturant is open. 
 turns out those delivery riders are human beings, just like you and me, and they need sleep and rest, just like you and me.


unlike a company that can rotate its staff between day shift and night shift, grab rides are contractors who set their own work hour, and they wisely choose to not work at night when business is slow, so they can sleep, so they can be awake during the day when business is hotter.  || It's weird. Travelled the world and this is the first time I'm seeing nothing available on a Saturday night in a city. Very strange. Googled it myself to see if maybe it's a religious thing, that's how I found your post...not sure why there's idiotic replies in this thread. Plenty of delivery late night the rest of the week, and everywhere else in the world there's usually more on a Saturday night. Very strange indeed. || Why are so many responses being an ass to OP. They said they are not local and simply asking why. || Your lazy ass can order a Grab ride to buy it yourself || rider earn the same even after 10pm. there's no incentive to do that job. they already earn the quota for the day etc. || mmm?? 

but the delivery is open at 1.30am onwards though. || I think it's cuz the traffic is so horrible its not worth it. || Maybe, but still weird cause traffic is way worse in places like Bangkok and I never had an issue there at any time of day any day of the week. Plus being on bikes they avoid a lot of the traffic."
"Thoughts on shopee food I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment? Shopee food app is stupid hard to navigate though, maybe I just need that learning curve, so wanna get a sense of if its worth it before I commit to anything.

I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad for shopee food, it isn't, I've brought them to tribunal court for their shit delivery twice. Always have used only Shopeefood. Cheaper and can use coins. The other two expensive lah || Shopee Food used to allow combination of 2 vouchers (1 for food discount, 1 for free/discount on delivery) which made is mad cheap! Now only 1 voucher is applicable || it's straight up shit.I understand if it is rainy or traffic holiday and no drivers can be found or not drivers wants to take the order. This is sunny day, no traffic and yet can't find any driver. Also I have to wait for an hour for it cancel automatically as it can't find any drivers. || Not enough vendors on ShopeeFood in my area. || Only the pricing is different maybe, the rider is same. Rider that I know he wear food panda cloth, bag, but when I ordered from shopee food, food panda arrive🤣. I use multiple platform and choose which had voucher or cheapest option😆 || i use both grab and shopee,mostly i used grab because delivery fee are cheap compared to shopee  
i have my mcdonald here cost 1 ringgit for delivery but shopee is 3 ringgit (example lah aiiyoo)  
but shopee is dominant for its discount/voucher,cant deny that  
for tracking order,grab no.1 for me,when rider move its follows along while shopee will skip skip their route (although i could just close-and-open the app to track *accurately*) || It will be cheaper until it become big, then they will jack up the price the like the two services. At that time, hopefully there will be another upcoming service which will be cheaper to attract customers || Is this true for most cases? I agree, grab ever since after mco it's been a huge rip off, delivery fee increase randomly, the discount is not really a discount, and the mark up is becoming insane. 25 bucks for a fried rice or something. || That seems to be an issue in my area as well, but then I'm also tired of all my grab vendor I've been using the last 3 years... Not much changed || I've just checked by except for McDonald's, which I guess is vip client to them, everything else is crazy markup, like my favourite Chinese store is 20% more expensive on grab. Having that said shopee doesn't even have the store lol"
"How much a Grab Food Driver earns per order or per day in Malaysia ?  If you do 8 hours a day, you might get RM 2k net a month. Might is dependent on many factors like tips, incentive Grab provides, order sizes, distance per order, etc. 

So it works out to roughly RM66 per day on a rough estimation. || My brother’s friend earns an average monthly salary of RM3-4k/ month in Penang || 60-80 ringgit average for 5 hours (klang valley) more if raining or weekend || As a Malaysian pr doing grab in sg,around SGD$5.5-6 || over 9000 ................ cents /s || If they rob the houses they deliver too ., Could be worth it. || Thats pretty low comparable to how much they have to travel and the amount of customer facing patience they have to go through. I remember how some years ago grab drivers were so proud of making 4-6k a month. || what about bike maintenance & fuel cost? || That's pretty low compared to what they claimed in the social media || Wdym ?"
"PSA to all the abg² Grab yg acah² alim This message is NOT for all the hardworking and kindhearted abg² Grab.

This PSA is for those who think they're super alim and it's their moral obligation to educate people while delivering food.

This is not the 1st time it has happened to me, I usually just ignore it when it happens but seriously, I'm getting sick and tired of it.

Yes I'm a Muslim hence my very islamic name. That said, what I order and where I order should not concern you. If it affects your beliefs or principles, then please do cancel my order - no judgement from my side.

You failed to do your research. Yes, the restaurant I ordered from is a Chinese restaurant but it's run by a fully vegetarian family that's been that way for YEARS. In my personal opinion, they're even more strict with their food than muslims.

On top of not properly checking before giving your ""nasihat"", I did not appreciate the way you gave it. You were so arrogant when you called my name > asking me whether I know it's a Chinese restaurant > about to hint it's not Halal before I told you its a 100% vegetarian restaurant.

So please, if this PSA ever reach you - mind your own damn business. Thank you.

Sincerely,
A really sick and tired Malaysian. Well, I've been waiting for this chance to share my experience. I'm a Muslim. I went to Ma'ahad (which is a school that combines academic & religion in your daily routine) for 5 years.

After I graduated. I went to work at these fruit shops which sell all kinds of drinks & foods based on fruit. Yes the owner is Chinese and for me a very good boss.

Okay here's the thing, one day I got an order from grab food and when the rider came to collect the order he noticed that I am Malay who is working in Chinese shops. Then he asked me: 

GF rider: ehh, kau melayu ke? Asal kerja kat sini. Dah takde kedai melayu ke kau nak kerja sini.

Me: haah bang, saya melayu.( I didn't respond to other questions)

GF rider: ni makanan kau buat ni halal ke? Customer ni orang melayu ni order.

Me: oh rojak ni 100% dari buah, so okay je kalau muslim nak makan.

GF rider: tak aku tanya makanan halal ke tak?! Aku bukan tanya ni rojak buah ke rojak apa?(with loud voice & rude attitude)

Me: ada buah tak halal ke bang? Setahu saya buah semua halal. Kalau abang tak nak amik order ni saya panggil rider lain.(we requested for another rider)

Then the rider was embarrassed & left the premises along with a few insults thrown at me and co-workers. Luckily there's no big fuss || Totally agreed on your point. I run a food stall too that sell cut fruits only but I’ve gotten call from customers that claimed that riders told them that the stall is Chinese run and “might” be not halal. || No digg, but I never get why Muslims are so critical/nosy of what their acquaintances and neighbours do.

I have fairly dark complexion which makes me look Malay, and I've been ""tegur"" by other riders when I'm eating in my car during puasa.

What the fuck mate? I'm not Malay, and it's none of your god damned business if I am. || There are a lot of chinese restaurant that cater to vegetarian and muslim customers. You just have to know which is which. Clearly the riders are more kmapung than some kampung people. My kampung's tok imam have no problem having breakfast at our local chinese kopitiam. || Lol Muslim around the world eat food made by non-muslim, especially made by vegetarians. Just as long as they don't have non-halal ingredients it's all good. Usually vegetable, eggs and fish are a non issue if there's no alcohol in it. How do they think muslim tourist eat in a non-muslim country? || I get you. I sometimes get some abang trying to preach and give unsolicited advice. Number 1, it's none of their business what I order. Number 2, *I'm not even Malay*. They just assume I am because I can speak fluently || Holier than thou attitude is bad. No matter from which race or religion || And this is why there's a green wave coming. Political Islam makes it their job to put their noses in others' affairs.

Malaysia needs to move back to a more laissez faire style of Islam ala pre-1990s.

The kind still practiced by Turkey, Indonesia, etc. || Cooked some chinese dish for my friend even try hard to make it halal like find replacement for chinese wine and ect(apparently can use white vinegar to replace it) then no one dare to eat i was like bro i half malay and i am muslim you think i want to feed yall pig is it? || YO I went throught same thing so this is what I did.  


1) condemn him with the worst review I could think of and demand for him to be resigned.   
2) Changed my name to a Borneo-ish name   
3) Leave the food at a designated place (atas pagar or something) so that I don't have to see their delusional faces."
"Grab Unlimited Fleecing Us Tldr, you’re paying more for delivery with the subscription plan than without! 🤡😡

>**HERE IS HOW** platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.

Enjoy the platform while it is good, then gtfo once you smell shit || I remember cancelling the plan when you cant use the discount vouchers at the times you would order food, like Lunch or Dinner, cant get discount from 12pm to 2pm or 6pm to 8pm. || I only use foodpanda with panda pro AND pestapanda for at least two people. Usually only for lunch. Too stingy to actually order for 1 person without any discounts and free delivery. || Shoppee food also sometimes have discounts for food delivery, keep a look out for that.

Grab Food ever since it started charging RM 4.90 hit the longkang real hard. I also stopped subscribing. The RM 15 discount for min RM 50 order was the main reason I stopped using them. || even they pay their rider RM11 for 3 delivery 🤡 || i check got free delivery if i subscribe during the trial period (i think is RM1 per month). so i subscribe before i place my order. after subscribe, i realized that free delivery is capped at RM3, still ok, cause i paid RM1 only.  then when checkout, the delivery fee increase by RM3 due to high traffic. i never use the grab food after that. || I don't know wtf Grab is doing these days, I haven't used them since I stopped WFH and all the Covid lockdown business has ended.

Regarding the ""eat home cooked food la"" thing, I will say if you want to treat yourself, just go out and eat la. Delivery food has been steaming in containers and isn't as nice. The business might also appreciate your patronage more also since you pay them directly. || Grab is still a scam. It says Jaya free delivery upon checking out I'm charged for delivery  fee + foreign card + packaging + quality assurance +  service. 
Evil greedy grab really.. I rather not order || Almost every delivery platform operates on the same idea: without promotion, the price will killed. What they are doing is just shaping people to use it, when you are so reliant on delivery in the future, regardless of the price you will pay for it, as you already incorporate into your necessary life."
"How much should I be giving Fellow Malaysians,

With the current economy and the job insecurity, how much do you pay your parents?

I am currently earning net RM5.2k. (approx figure), but cannot seem to satisfy my mom. I have PTPTN debt and that’s it. I do not have a car or a place myself. Currently renting a place in KL while my parents are both doing small businesses in hometown (Ipoh). 

Every time I call my mom, all she talk about is how I should be supporting them more, how I should save my money and not spend so much on myself, etc.

Bear in mind, my current expenses usually revolves around parents pocket money (300-500/month), sports (300/month), food (1,000-1,200/month), rent (1,000/month), other bills (300/month) and almost nothing else. Perhaps monthly entertainment at most RM1,000*. Also, my job is very demanding (work from 9AM-2AM daily). Hence, I usually have to grab food/tapao. 

* This might include things like buying an office chair, sometimes hair cut, sometimes could be sports item, etc. I don’t drink/smoke/go to cinema/do any sorts of other entertainment, besides my sports.

I’m not sure if I am a big spender right here, I really don’t know. But I feel like I am not? And it just annoys me that every time I call my mom, she nags me about saving money and tell me to support them more. 

So the question now is,
1. How much do you earn and how much of it is used to pay parents? Please also indicate if you stay with your parents (rental is not easy).
2. Honestly, tell me if I am a big spender?


EDIT: Just to be clear, entertainment here also includes sports wear, work wear, skincare, shoes, physio treatment (unfortunately I do extreme sports so I have to go for physio monthly), facial, subscriptions, sometimes overspent weekend dinner, monitor (for my wfh setup), massage, etc.

EDIT 2: 5.2k is net y’all. Gross is 6+. I also earn claims occasionally if I work in clients place (which is rare these days). As such, minimum savings is 1k, will increase if i’ve claims. Keep your conversations short and bi-weekly, to monthly. You're an adult, your well being comes first.

 Some eldery people have old fashion toxic mindsets, we can't change them, but can take steps to minimise nonsense.

It's your money, you are in control of it. || Sorry to say, but I think that parents demanding pocket money is already a sign of an unhealthy relationship.

If I'm bringing a human to this world, do I expect him to look after me when I'm old? He didn't ask to be born. Plus, for how long will I be able to force him to come see me and pay for me? There's also the modern realities of life, where its very difficult for the average Malaysian to afford a home, car, family, etc. Why even decide to have children in the first place if so many things are stacked against them having a decent life?

To me, a healthy relationship should be one filled with love, where the parent puts no expectation on the child to look after him and the child wants to look after the parent by choice. Everyone should try to live up to this ideal. || Wait..you're working for  17 hours daily? Is this for real? I can't comment on the 1st question but for the 2nd one...I think you're fine. I guess your food expenditure is a bit high but that could be reasonable possibly since you tapau food daily...Anyways your weight to height ratio is normal...It's kinda toxic that your mother thinks this way. Maybe you could talk to her about this if it's disturbing you mentally. || On top of these finances comments, she also constantly tell me that I am fat? I am 66kg, 168cm - female. She constantly ask me to stop eating meaty/cheesy food when I’ve been eating salad daily and doing sports 3-4 times/week. It’s killing me to talk to her. || I cant help but bringing gender into this. 

I was guessing you are most likely a female based on the fact that your mum is stressing out not giving enough and constantly criticize your lifestyle and body.  

Just cant imagine mum doing the same to her son. Maybe something for you to think about. || She needs to understand that 5k in 2022 especially in KL really isn't a lot. You're still able to spend on yourself because you don't have a car. Imagine if you had a car; monthly installment, petrol, tol, maintenance, rtax/insurance... then you'd be eating gardenia, maggi and economy rice every single day. Maybe something nice on the weekends. Hell, most of the time I'm in Ipoh and my spending on food is around RM30-50/day. Weekends lain kira (dining out, booze, massage, etc.). 

So I can't say if you're a big spender, but you always have a choice; make M40 money, live a B40 lifestyle. Save half of your paycheck, live on the other half. It's what I used to do, but not anymore lol. Ultimately it's totally up to you. || Sorry to say but your mum is displaying serious narcissistic behaviour. I get it that she is your mum but that doesn’t mean that you should tolerate such toxic behaviour. If it’s an option maybe you can speak to your dad about this? You can let him know that your mum is putting a lot of pressure on you, tell him as it is you are working 17 hours a day so you definitely not need this added pressure. 

And some friendly advice for the future - maybe it’s best not to disclose your salary to your parents. 5.2k may sound alot to parents from a small town like Ipoh because they may not be able to comprehend the high cost of living in KL. 

And also…never ever feel guilty for spending your hard earn money on yourself (sports, entertainment or otherwise) otherwise you will suffer from serious burnout and resent work. 

All the best to you! || I don't give my parents money. I insisted but they told me they are well off and i should invest into my future. But i treat the whole family to dinner at a fancy restaurant once a month || Y don’t you flip it ? Every day, when your parents call, complain about your job, pay cut, after a few months say u lost your job need to find another job. (Plan wisely what to say, when to say) tell her new job pay sucks, lower pay longer hours, feeling remorse, bla bla bla.
Unable to survive much like the previous job. But hope you all are ok. It’s not being selfish but you have to take care of yourself also. Keep giving what you give. To her.. if She ask have you eaten or something. Just say not hungry. U need to show negative. || Ngl i do feel like you're quite a big spender, but it probably is partly due to the amount of work and stress you deal with (thus wanting to spend to destress?). But regardless of what i say, to each of their own. I also think that parents shouldn't treat their children as an investment so whatever comments they have made is pretty unjustified to me."
"I ordered via Grab and got a Rounding Adjustment of RM29.47 and 2 missing food items.  Bloody hell..

That rounding didnt even give u a nice round number at the end.. wtf || Usually when stuff like this happens, first and foremost, i would open the contact grab function and report missing / incorrect order, then i would upload through the apps photos of my receipt and the entire order still inside the plastic bag as proof. So far I have always gotten a refund for the items, frustrating but hey you get your money back. || Epic Food Hall Mont Kiara has always been shockingly garbage anytime I've had the misfortune of ordering from there. || Made an update post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/wf0y21/update_ordered_via_grab_got_charged_rm2944_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Hey OP here, this is KL area.
I have already sent an email to Grab.
Edit: I finally opened the food. Picture in the linked word. I'm done.

So I ordered from a place called Epic Food Hall Mont Kiara,
1 Bolognese Spaghetti with a Coke
1 Sirloin Burger
1 Bimbimbap

Was charged RM 52.50 for the total.

Out of the 3, I only got 1 of the items which was Bolognese Spaghetti. Which was [saucesless.](https://imgur.com/a/NC8sYGv) Fucking hell.

As you can see in the receipt, I was charged a ridiculous amount in Rounding Adjustment. Which the total of said receipt is RM 46.33. 

I am honestly just stunned and the cashier's negligence in not thinking, shouldn't the rounding be... You know... A few cents? Not RM30??

Other than sending support a message, anything else I can do? || if foodpanda, i will immediately take screenshot of the food  
& send then request to live agent

"Malaysia hands down winner!! Ive been lucky enough to travel all over the world. For the last 20 years my quest of exceedingly consistent great food has ended here in Johor Bahru!! 

I set myself a few parameters and to judge a nations quality and choice of foods offered including local cuisine of course! 
We have travelled through SE asia for 3 months now and using food panda, grab etc as well as eating in.

Malaysians.. you lucky lucky people!! Your food here is absolutely delectable!! everything is bloody delicious!! Im definately coming back here! spending my last 10 days stuffing my chops… any local recommendations for JB greatly received. 🙏🙏👏👏 When I spend time overseas, I frequently hear people ask why Malaysians are constantly talking about food.

Now you understand. And you can join the food conversations now. Welcome to the club. || If you're still in JB, and in the city in the afternoon, try the Banana Cake at Hiap Joo Bakery at Jalan Tan Hiok Nee. It tastes good at any time, but if you can get it right after it comes out of the 100 year old woodfire oven, it's heavenly! Takeaways only, but there are many coffee shops and cafes nearby for you to enjoy it with afternoon tea or coffee!

https://maps.app.goo.gl/4vUzDVbN6U6fRpKA9 || What are your opinions about Malaysian food compared to our neighboring countries like Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia? Being someone who travelled extensively around this region, I think you would have the chance to sample each country's unique cuisine.

No one ask for it, but here's my take anyways. The variety of food in Malaysia is probably the widest in SEA, mostly due to the fact we are a multicultural society rather than an assimilated one like Indonesia, Thailand or Vietnam. Their food is excellent, but it's more focused and narrow. 

The closest comparison to Malaysia is obviously Singapore. However, Singapore's local cuisines are only comparable to what we have in Malaysian urban areas (Standard stuff like Nasi Lemak, Char Kuey Teow etc.). What they do not get to experience is the crazy variety of food options from the East Coast and Borneo. || Food =

1. Nasi Lemak
2. Durian (Durian season is coming next month or two.)
3. Nasi Kerabu
4. Char kuey teow
5. Roti Canai, Roti Tisu, Roti boom, Roti Telur || I’m Malaysian but lives in the UK. A lot of people here said Malaysia has the best duck. Idk coz I never into duck in Malaysia. Probably try duck if you can. || As a Penang food elitist I’ll say that Johor food is nothing special ^fight ^me || Google “nasi goreng bawah tangga”. Best seafood fried rice. Order sambal sotong as a dish too || Would you consider visiting East Malaysia anytime soon? You should definitely try Sarawak Laksa!

"Need advice on managing money and paying for stuff in Malaysia for an expat without local bank account I am entering Malaysia this Friday. It will take a week or two for my employer to open a bank account. I will be in home quarantine for the first week of my stay and will be alone. I will be staying in Subang Jaya where I have rented a condo with a 2 year contract. I will be carrying some amount of Malaysian Ringgits with me but I don't want to carry too much cash. None of my credits cards seem to work on Grab and Food Panda. During quarantine, I would like to order food and groceries through these apps. What are my options? Is there any local prepaid card I can get that can be used on these platforms? My credit cards have been enabled for international transactions and my bank is saying the cards are getting declined at the merchant side. In general, even after quarantine will I have issues using overseas cards in Malaysian stores and restaurants? Our payment processor usually accepts Visa and Master, to a lesser extent Amex and rarely the others. If you're in either Visa or Master it should be fine.

But I recall reading about things related to country of origin, which if you're from countries such as Russia, Iran, Syria or North Korea, which papa US and A hates and sanctions, you can be blocked too because everyone need to play nice with papa US and A.

Otherwise... I have no idea || You can sign up for wise and get the debit card to spend with it || You could use a prepaid card from these platforms

•[MAE](https://www.maybank2u.com.my/maybank2u/malaysia/en/personal/services/digital_banking/mae_by_maybank2u.page)- an eWallet from Maybank (local bank) comes with bank account details; top up via Visa/MasterCard.

•[BigPay](https://www.bigpayme.com)- an eWallet from AirAsia (local airline company), you can top up via Visa/MasterCard, FPX (online banking) and in store via 7-Eleven (however they do charge 2% for cash reloads), unfortunately no bank account details.

•[Wise](https://wise.com)- foreign eWallet with bank account details from 10 countries (from the UK & and has Malaysian bank account details, from JPMorganChase and as long as you registered your account in Malaysia).

All can be registered online but require a Malaysian phone number and address. Wise however, is available in most places. || Use YouTrip or revolut.

"Is there other Food Delivery better than Grab? Is there any other food delivery that is better than Grab? The reason why I am using Grab is because it is tied to Grab car which I mostly use, and since they share the wallet, it's convenient.

However, recently I am noticing something odd with how their app shows which shop is ""available"" or which is ""out of delivery area"", which I find concerning. Whether you're a customer ordering food, or a shop selling food, or even the grab delivery rider, I think it's something to look at. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking at other food delivery apps.

A bit of back story, I wanted to order food from a favorite shop, which is relatively near to my place. Unfortunately, I couldn't order as the shop is ""whited out"" stating it is ""out of delivery area"". However, I noticed some shops that are of similar distance are available. I asked their Twitter support as to what's the reasoning for this one, and they said that it's either lack of delivery riders in the area or ""due to weather"". It wasn't lunch time so it wasn't peak hours, nor was it raining at that time. They said that this is how the app automatically handles such situations. And because of this logic, the app suggests shops that are > 10km away, however it chargers delivery for the same amount as that of when the shop is just near.

This to me seems like a red flag if I am a food seller or a delivery rider on their platform. If I'm a seller, I would be mad if I found that the app is blocking me from getting orders on the pretext that the app assumes there's no delivery riders nearby. If I'm a delivery rider, I would end up having to deliver to people that are so far away, only to be paid a measly amount as delivery.

It doesn't make sense to me as to why they have the need to disable the shop. Why don't they just put a premium on the delivery charge like how they add premium to grab car whenever it's peak hours? It's their delivery riders' prerogative if they want to take the delivery or not. The shop gets their orders, the delivery riders gets paid extra, and the customer gets the food that they want, everyone is happy. It could be that the particular restaurant disabled the GrabFood app from their side due to reasons e.g. not enough staff to handle both dine in customer orders and food delivery orders. || [deleted] || Try shoopee food, some riders/shops move over there( enjoying the honeymoon period), that might be the reason :-s || Try Beepit || Try AirAsia, Gojek and Food panda || I've seen AirAsiaFood. do they offer BIG points when you purchase from their platform? I'm going to assume they integrated their food delivery with their Airlines mileage program, at least. || and those vouchers cut off big boi prices, just need more restaurants on there. || thanks! I'll check it out. do they use their Shopeepay as payment option or do you have to pay via online banking? || yeah I'm using beepit to order from a specific shop that is only available in their app. I think the advantage is I can pay using grab pay too. || I've tried food panda once. I like that they have those smaller shops in their platform."

"Am I the only encountering this? So I ordered something on FoodPanda, which costs like RM21 (I know, severely overpriced) but they only delivered the soup to me, without the noodles & stuff. So naturally I contacted support asking for a refund, and they just proceeded without my consent and played it off saying I confirmed it and they're unable to modify the refund amount. They refused to provide help after and kept copy and pasting the same message, and eventually cornering me into accepting a RM5 voucher. Yeah that is another reason why I stopped using FoodPanda. 

I ordered I think it was KFC or something, and was missing the biggest portion of things and it was itemized as RM20 something. 

I was offered RM5 refund.

This is atrocious especially doing it during festival season. I hope pro bono lawyers will came forward to sue the company. || I understand the need to save money. But the truth is, our discounts have to be subsidised by someone else. It could be FoodPanda’s shareholders, FoodPanda, the vendors, and/or the riders.

I highly doubt investors still want to continue to plough money into FoodPanda since it’s already a maturing company. When there is no more cash infusion, FoodPanda has to be judicious with its working capital. It cannot simply throw out prices like it used to three or four years ago. Vendors have [expressed their discontent with FoodPanda over hidden charges and the lack of transparency in payments](https://themalaysianreserve.com/2021/11/09/vendors-on-foodpanda-protest-hidden-costs/). [Commissions paid to FoodPanda are also already high](https://www.thesundaily.my/home/30-fee-for-delivery-service-too-high-say-eatery-operators-LG8181591), making their margins razor-thin. If the food prices are too cheap, then it may not be economical for the vendors to sell food and drinks on FoodPanda. But many are desperate for sales because there are just too many competition.

I feel that if we were to use a food delivery service, it would be only fair to pay a bit extra. Logically speaking, there is a middleman that needs to make money. There is also cost to deliver the food. We are getting the convenience of having the food delivered to our doorstep, so there should be a premium for the convenience.

This is why I have always questioned the viability of all these e-commerce platforms. They throw discounts like crazy and make consumers expect cheap prices will continue forever. But money will be burned in the process, the riders’ pays continue to be suppressed, and more often than not we get subpar services. It’s a no-win scenario for everyone in the long term. || Shitty company with shitty policies that trouble both the customer and rider. It's about time the youth should realize that the reality of being a full time gig workers. 

Not only it doesn't guarantee stable income, it also curbing your progress in which you better spend the time learning a handy skill that have better prospect in generating income.

The current delivery market are too oversaturated and it is not longer as profitable as it used to be during MCO time. In the end, gig jobs are just to supplement your income not as the main job.

Edit: Downvote me for what? It is known that gig jobs for long term are not feasible. I understand his plight and certainly stand with him on this matter.

There are other ways to escalate any cases as well. I feel the team managing the riders in FP are highly motivated and perform several activities to engage their riders compared to the others. I feel there is a way to resolve this amicably. But perhaps the way this is managed in MY is different from SG?"

"Grab Food atau Food Panda? Hello semua. Saya nak mulakan pekerjaan sebagai rider antara dua ni. Saya di Seremban. Manakah lebih berbaloi untuk dipilih dari segi pulangan harian, kelecehan bekerja atau lain2 hal. Harap boleh beri pendapat, terima kasih.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ms8j0t) Hey, someone can add more stuff later or correct me if I am wrong, but afaik:

Foodpanda pay more, and it is easier since you only need to deliver in certain area only. Normally you can earn around rm3k to 4k+ (depend on place) monthly. But the problem is you will need to follow the timetable provided if you want to work. There is a limited amount of rider for each area, and once it filled up, you will need to do it somewhere else.

Grabfood seem more relax since you can switch on the delivery app anytime you want, but you will have to deliver stuff farther away. So you will need better Moto compare to FP. You don't have to deal with rainy day for GF since you can just switch it off when you want to, unless you are currently delivering something. As for pay, I think rm80+ in 6+ hours depend on place, which is slightly lower than FP. 

Personally I will pick Grabfood, mainly for the fact that you don't need to fight for space in timetable. And right now it is always rain heavily in the evening. If you don't want to deal with that, you can just switch off your apps. || Terima kasih kepada semua yang terlibat memberi pendapat. Saya amat hargai! || [removed] || With GF you can withdraw your income anytime you want, FP you need to wait the next Wednesday/Thursday (depending on what bank you're using) to receive your salary.



FP has a weekly performance evaluation, which affect your batch. Your batch determines how much you get paid per order, starting from the lowest which is rm4.50 (I think?) to the highest which is rm7. GF have none of that. || I also want to add regarding safety:


Foodpanda.

1. You deliver stuff ""locally"" or in certain area only. 
2. You will have a timer which will affect your performances, which will affect your batch, which will affect your pay. 
3. You will get used to road conditions in that area after a few weeks, so you can avoid potholes, dangerous area easily later.
4. You will have to work even in rainy day after you filled your timetable.
5. You will have to deal with cash and deposit them at the end of the day.

Grabfood.

1. You will have to deliver stuff farther away especially on weekend since most rider will take a break in weekend.
2. You probably someday will have to navigate in an area that you never been before. Beside the fact that it is dangerous for you to use phone (GPS) will riding, you won't know how is the road conditions in that new place until you get used to it.
3. You don't have to deal with rainy day or peak hours if you want to, or at least until you get better at it.
4. Since you may deliver stuff farther away, you have to make sure that your motorcycle is in good condition. It is very annoying if your ride broke down in the middle of somewhere that you had never been before.

Side note: you will have to carry cash for Foodpanda. Although it doesn't happen often, but there are cases where riders got robbed. My friend told me that in most cases, the perpetrator will ordered KFC/MCD up to rm300 and ask you to deliver to quiet place. You won't have to deal with this stuff since grabfood don't accept cash.

Oh and if you choose grabfood, you can choose between being a Halal rider or non halal. Check your area first. Most places it will better for being halal rider. In certain area, both can give you decent amount of delivery. If you work in that area and choose non halal, you won't receive order from KFC/MCD/etc. Which can be better since you don't have to deal with KFC/MCD order in peak hour which can delay you for a bit. || [removed] || Thread nuked.

Thou I mixed feelings when they break the road law, thou... || on the flipside i recently encountered a less than ideal situation with a grabfood rider, he took my order and was halfway to my house, but decided to turn back unexpectedly and head back to the restaurant, because he had a second order there and decided it was more conveninet for him to do that, even though if he would just continue to send it to me and head back, that second order would not have finished cooking either. ultimately, he left me in the dark until he reached back the shop and informed me, and by the time he got to me it was 15-20 minutes later than what it would be.

Thought of giving them another chance as they tend to have more choice but changed my mind after reading this post. Thanks || i prefer foodpanda. in subang jaya its really efficient. probably only had 3 cancelled orders for the past year of using it. || Used to use both....but nowadays food panda sucks balls compared to grabfood.

&#x200B;

Im currently using grab food subscription, for RM25 a month, i get RM10x3 off voucher, and RM5x15 off voucher AND grab points.

&#x200B;

Just this month alone, i have redeemed rm50+ of savings by paying with grabpay and using the points to get instant rebate

&#x200B;

I order 2-3 times a week grabfood, its never been late last 2 months, and food arrives within 20-25min and still hot. || I havent had a successful Grab Food order. They keep cancelling on me. Foodpanda have been super reliable. || GrabFood has more choices for me in my area compared to FoodPanda! The only downside is that you can’t pay with cash with GrabFood and most of the time my bank account is at its bare minimum lol, so if I’m super desperate I usually go with FoodPanda since I can pay with cash. So far haven’t had a bad experience with either in terms of delivery time, order not complete etc. || Agree. Foodpanda never late as far for my orders, only need to order multiple times if using cash-less. I thought the transaction went thru, but after couple of refresh, it is auto-cancelled."
"M'sian Grab Driver Eats Cake Which Was Damaged During Delivery, Garners Sympathy From Netizens | WeirdKaya  I believe that tipping culture when done through 3rd party apps (Grab and others) will invite more problems. Such as a) decentivise companies to increase wages. b) increase the number of people opt in gig economy (which I think should not be for individuals that CAN work a normal office job) and c) I feel like it gives incentives for the driver to grade us.

Correct me if im wrong but if I don't tip the Grab driver or give low tip, can they know? Wouldn't that make them rate me lower than 5* even though my behaviour is civil while in their presence. And if I'm rate lower than 5*, then I would get bad/unsafe drivers. Is that logic correct or am I just overthinking this system of both rate the driver and the passenger. || Sad ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|28915)

Wish the grab drive more successful delivery and get customers who tip big in cash. ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26558) || I want to feel bad, I do. Knowing the struggles of having no choice but to work with what you can do and can earn in this ever increasing price hikes economy. The customer can't fully be at fault too, maybe it's a birthday cake for someone so it has to be presented nice, but then if you really adore the person you would have went out and bought it yourself tbh. If they reject it cause they can't put it on Instagram for clout, shame on them.

However, we don't know how the drive drove. Knowing how majority of the grab drivers are speeding past you in lanes, taking corners dangerously, rushing orders cause the restaurant was late knowing they survive on number of trips made.

There many sides to the story that we can't see. Was the person who ordered the cake entitled? Possibly. Was the rider going fast and the cake moved a lot in the bag? Possibly. We just don't fully know what happened is what I'm saying. || [removed] || Story sounds fake. Customer ask him pay back RM 60 for ""damaged"" cake and he do it and wife just happens to capture him on video eating cake sadly? || [deleted] || its kinda sad to see that rider eating a deformed cake

its not his fault though, just trying to make ends meet only for his family

and the customer whos order it, its not wrong either || >Muhammad Fadzil added the RM60, which he had borrowed from his sister, was a huge burden for him as it was the end of the month and his child’s baby formula had run out.

In the grand scheme of thing, the cake issue is irrelevant.

He needs a different job. || We already have a tipping culture via service tax if you think about it.

Price of food at a restaurant is ingredients, time to make and serve, (maybe environment) That's why your Char Kueh Teow at the road side cost like RM7 but in restaurant like Little Penang at KLCC/IKEA is RM18+. That's on menu price.

Then the service tax is for? Their tips obviously. But somewhere along the way owners decided to pocket it too. Anyone who work as a wait staff don't see any extra money when the shop is busy. Just more fatigue at the end of day.

It's the same shit with that credit card charge too. It's supposed to be for the store cause they pay for that particular service, but who pays for it? The customers obviously. || As a grabfood rider, I don't care much if my customer didn't tips me (grateful if they were) its didn't affect how i rate them as customer. I guess that's apply to almost all rider i met unless we met some problematic customer (complaint about being late, blamed for spilled, etc)"
"What is there biggest everyday scams thay everyone put up with? 1. Grab, there's so many complaints already about Grab but what I hate is the ""Grab Unlimited"" which is kononnya Grab Pro lah, they advertised it as free unlimited free delivery, which is false, it is limited, and it's only limited to RM3, let say the delivery is RM5 then you still have to pay for RM2. Not only that, you can only use this feature if you order minimum of RM20. 
  
2. Telco
It used to be a bigger scam, 20GB plan but 2gb in the day, 18gb from midnight till 6am, wtf?
And unlimited internet is not even unlimited, it's capped, and even the speed is capped, just give me unlimited internet mobile plan which us unlimited! I'll pay. 
  
3. Mobile legends (and many other games) are a money making machines, it's a gambling game, and I fell for it every single time. You can't just buy the very skin you wanted but you have to spin this sh*t and spend more than you would if you just pay directly, what a total scam which a lot of kids (and me) fell for. 
  
What else scams that were normalised in everyday life. Free Shipping to Whole Malaysia!!!

^(\*except Sabah & Sarawak) || Shoppee vouchers

50% off, capped at rm2

RM5 off, min spend rm100 || Office working hours is 8:30 - 5:30 pm, 5 working days. 
In reality we are scammed to work OT and be on standby during weekend to answer bosses/ seniors questions or to prep for Monday. || Discount, cashback vouchers with cap from online shopping platforms. Also, the ""FREE"" shipping vouchers that isn't really FREE. || Asking for RM3,000 salary, but employer offered RM2,000 *plus benefits*.

Like, I get it, it's part of the package. But I can't use my medical insurance benefits to pay for rental or buy groceries. || Food ads are scam. Always get not as pictured.

""For illustration only"", my a$$. || Shopee: free postage to whole Malaysia 


Alsp shopee: Except for sabah and sarawak. || Tolls in KL are a scam, most journeys are like 5-10 minutes and you gotta pay good money for it. And most of the time the tolled roads itself are jammed too 

Sprint Highway is super aggreguous, RM2.50 for that part of the road under the bridge which is 2-3 minutes drive lol 

And also I've been saying this for many years they need to have peak/non peak rates for these tolls. 100% for peak times, 50% for non peak, and free from 1AM-5AM || Malaysia government. When they say every one is equal || Study science stream guarantees a bright future. Total bs.

Edit typo"
"PSA: dont bother with grab premium delivery, CS wont even do anything about it.  I feel like this is a grab UI thing— they explained they were pressing the button to notify they have received the food and am on the way to deliver— but will accidentally double press as their phone sangkut and on next tap ter tap the delivered button. The times these happened to me I complained to grab and received 5rm compensation || Wth i did pay for premium before so its just placebo? Cause here grab rider will actually run 2 jobs. Had one kept me waiting for 1 hr! || Should come with captcha to confirm item delivered. || I tried it once. My delivery was late, when I contact customer service, they readjust the delivery time and of course the driver arrived on time. Once bitten twice shy.

On the other hand once I order food panda (FP) and the delivery driver forgot to tap delivered. I didn't realized until FP send me RM6 voucher for late delivery. I contacted FP to tell them driver wasn't late but FP let me keep and use the voucher. || I would be so pissed this happened to me but the order arrived late and I cant claim free voucher (because it arrived ""early"" in the app). || Do they get penalised out of own pocket if late delivery when it's premium delivery. Can't imagine it happening twice to the same person. || I ordered a kfc meal for me and my friends days ago. Order came like pigs feed. Requested for refund over missing items and drinks which were only half filled. In the end CS decided to just ghost us. SMH grab. || Grab itself is a scam || it could be a UI thing if this is a normal delivery, but this being a premium delivery just trigger a red flag. If your order arrived late with premium delivery, you are entitled with free voucher so \*shrug\* || Yup. GrabRider UI is bad. Source: Me. I'm lucky to buy a higher end of smartphone to compensate for unoptimized UI(and for playing Genshin Impact and CoDM), so this problem is almost non-existent. Still got lag spikes though."
"Grab adds food delivery and e-wallet to its list of services  > Soon, you can wake up, book a **GrabCar** to get to work, pay for your favourite nasi lemak during lunch, deliver gifts to your loved ones through **GrabExpress** and order your dinner with **GrabFood** - all enabled by one mobile wallet, **GrabPay**. || Apparently, UberEats is still operating in Malaysia. They're the best one I've used so far. || Do i even need a mobile wallet when i can pay directly using my cards? Been using ubereat and uber abroad using my cards and its a lot easier since i can just check my statement afterwards. || Sooo excited!!!!! Looking for local player to copy paste alipay to malaysia  || They finally got approval to operate as more than just Grab's cashless option? Nice!

...I wonder what the vendor adoption rates will be like."
"Shoppe Food... I recently placed an order on Shopee Food. The order was confirmed, and I saw the rider on the app going to pick it up.rest will be in screenshots 
This reminded me of a John Oliver episode I watched on YouTube a few days ago about i food delivery apps. Ironically, something similar just happened to me today... 

Has anyone else who uses Shopee Food experienced something similar? U ordered food from a shop called tasteless? || The tasteless cafe ???? || [removed] || Early days of shopee food with insane stacking promo vouchers were some of the best days. || I ordered bask bear from shopeefood before. Tengok2 the shop is closed when the rider arrived. Terus cancel and dapat duit balik tapi masatu patah seribu hatiku sebab craving || Go look up John Oliver's episode on food delivery app. || Sounds like the driver don't want to deliver and making you cancel. || ![gif](giphy|xUNda0p0pP0JYkAShG|downsized) || OP has no taste! || It's an Indian cuisine restaurant and their food is good."
"Shopee Food Bukit Jalil cancelled two days straight because no Abang delivery, what happened?  Most people advice them to escape gig jobs. This is the results. || I use panda but the delivery fee is too damn high nowadays || * nasi + paru + sayur
* peria goreng
* papadom

rm40 ringgit? || abam delivery finally figured out they need a real job || Just tried Woodfire the first time last weekend. Not bad. Does this happen to other food delivery service at that area as well? || Abang delivery saw your order, and decided you should go on a diet.   
  
Gosh do you poop smoothly? || Downfall of GRAB || Shit pay for the riders not even worth delivering lol. || Tried Shopee food before but the service sucks! Had my orders cancelled for no reason, pending and delayed. And worse part is when the order is pending, because it takes forever for them to find a delivery person, it won’t allow me to cancel from my end! I once ordered and I had to wait for 30-45mins and it cancelled automatically without any notification. While waiting, I resorted to ordering through other channel instead. And the refund process was a headache too. So now I’ve stopped using it. Despite the high delivery cost, I still use grab, and on occasions Beep it (I like beep it actually, have no issues thus far). Food panda is good but usually they cater small businesses, so anything goreng2 would be through panda. || I think people go back kampung for first day of Ramadan."
"Foodpanda vs grab vs shopeefood Hi all, Im the one who always ordered food online to avoid people and i found that ordering online saves a lot of money using the voucher and i can also ordering in bulk and save it for dinner or tomorrows lunch. Ive subscribed to panda pro and grabunlimited before. Didnt renew last yr for grabunlimed since it doesnt seem to be worth if for the discount given. Renewed panda pro as it gave lots of discount but lately the voucher and discount keep on decreasing. So i dont think i will renew it once it expire. And now i saw grabunlimed have few interesting voucher. Should i subscribe it. Meanwhile, for shopee food, i think the price was definitely higher makup than other 2 even the voucher was 12off, feels like only rm5 off from the real price. Which one is betger and what do u guys think?   I stopped grab and fp due to price markup. Use misi rakyat nowadays since they are still using harga kedai. But be warned, the app is janky as fuck and selection is limited since it's not popular. || Last time in penang area we used to have delivereat then it was bought over by airasia. Now its shit. What I like about delivereat was I can order from multiple shop within one same area in one order. Usually like shop in mall or foodcourt I can mix order from different shop || I used both. Because there are some gaps when you only uses one of them (i.e. some restaurant only use one of them).

Plus, either of them can be cheaper than the other but Foodpanda delivery fee is definitely better no doubt. GrabFood can easily reach RM8 - RM15 in delivery fee alone || I use grabfood. Foodpanda for my area charges ridiculously  higher expensive delivery than grab for the same store and distance. Plus, with delivery discount for rm20 above, I usually have free delivery. Used to be loyal to foodpanda when they had free delivery with no cap. 

And then during deals with grab, like buy 1 free 1, you could save a lot. Like for example today was the buy 1 free 1 and my total order was RM101 and only paid around RM38. || Im still using grab. Sometimes there is grab promo 'buy 1 another 1 50% off' and 'buy 1 free 1'. Not exactly free, but still cut alot of price. If use together with grabunlimited, can get 3-4portion food for rm20 (depend on distance also and food price). || I used grab because normally I order from Lotus for barang mentah. And between panda Vs grab for delivery fee, I prefer grab because more cheaper that panda."
"Has this happened to you guys on shopeefood? I just ordered through shopeefood while at work for lunch and its just been saying “assigning driver for you” for the past hour.I have already made payment through online banking and its gonna take 1-3 days to get it refunded.Its probably cuz of the peak hour(lunchtime) but for an entire hour n still no driver? 

I cant exactly leave my workplace and im hungry with no food:( Ya happen before. Its because they are cutting cost and less riders. During covid not even 2 mins needed to find rider. Now takes 50 mins. The riders are doing same day delivery and food delivery at same time. || Happened to me once too, over an hour, no rider, I scrolled down and they let me cancel it. But I think they'd automatically cancel it for you too if it's just idling there for over an hour. 

But I got my refund almost immediately, I withdrew my money and went back to ordering with grab because shopee food has close to no riders most of the time - especially when it's peak hour or it's raining (I used to work in fnb and our shopee device is literally dead - no one really orders from shopee hence why there's little to no drivers at all. The only damned device sound you'll hear on repeat is the foodpanda and grabfood one) || Many times if you are at UPM hospital. No driver. Grab has drivers. || Use spaylater next time so it’s not your cc or bank in money. I also kena many times then had to wait half hr before can click the cancel button. But shopee food cheaper with the vouchers and coin deductions. So i still try my luck each time 😅 || sometimes its the system. my friend who does shopeefood sometimes says the system assigns them stupidly far away pickup points or far away drop off points for short drop off points price. so all of the riders will just log off for a few hours.   
  
he once showed me a pickup at tmn dato keramat to send to sri kembangan for rm5. 

so yeah sometimes the system glithces so hard that nobody wants to work. || There are no riders available. Or maybe riders rejected your order. Or maybe the system is f**ked. Thats all i can think of 😂 || Few times especially when using delivery vouchers. No longer use ShopeeFood and use Grab instead. COD my orders so didnt matter if they decide to cancel. || Normally will auto cancel after no driver for awhile. U might better order a bit early if during peak time. || You should top up your Shopee pay and use it instead. Because once the order is cancelled, the amount are automatically debited back to your account. 
And it’s difficult to assign driver if it’s rainy day/ peak lunch or dinner break. It’s better to order 1 hour before the break time. || I wouldn't recommend using shopeefood, use foodpanda or grabfood instead, more riders seemingly work for them"
"Ayam Goreng Kunyit Meletops @ Jalan Perak RM11.88 for nasi ayam goreng kunyit telur mata. Order 3 packs of this + 1 extra telur mata to meet minimum spend for ShopeeFood discount.

Paid total of RM29.65 inclusive delivery for the order.

Good chicken to veggie ratio. Chicken is seasoned well. Worth the price & convenience imo. Eggs have runny yolks too. 7.5/10 serius la 11.88..one place i order RM 9 Chicken + Daging.. || Just remembered there is a Mat Rock close by & will compare that with this one next week. || Wei this portion is so generous! Worry the price. Cheap and cheerful. Also, I noticed it'd not too oily after you separated the vege and chicken, the rice is not overly oily.

I'm having this at most warung around Penang but half your chicken and with telor mata, close to RM 10. || My first year I started working, makan lunch benda ni je 2-3 a week. Sebab ada colleague kemaruk sangat. || Masak dekat lori juga ras lagi sedap dari kedai. || Kira murah tu... Dapat telur mata lg... Saya beli nasi+ayam goreng kunyit rm10...😞😞😞
Dh la sambal dgn kicap xda... || It is via delivery after all. And after deducting the discount, comes to under 10 a pack. I might think twice about ordering without the delivery & item discount. || Benda ni macam comfort food. Letak kicap manis dah leh makan. Susah nak fakap benda ni kecuali hangit, berminyak sangat atau ayam tak segar. Harga pun kira marhaen ada telur, ayam, sayur & nasi. || Brickfields depan monorail RM8 dengan telur mata. Sedap giler. Ayam pun banyak || Betul. Tapi food truck tempat i beli tu setiap 1-2 tahun naik 50cent. Dari harga 6 now dah ,8"
"Looking for food recommendation in Kuantan I'm from Thailand and currently in Kuantan for Malaysia Coffee Week. This is my first time in Kuantan. I’m staying around East Coast Mall and Skytree Hotel, and I would like to get food recommendation nearby ideally within walking distance. If it's not walking but Grab reachable, I'm okay also.

I'm good with anything, Malay, Chinese, Indian. Any popular dishes or good places? Preferably dinner place for the evening.

Thank you so much in advance! Welcome to my hometown! For food recommendations, you can try these:

1. Air Putih Cendol - You can order it on Grabfood, must-order if you have a sweet tooth
2. Mail Ikan Bakar - The touristy one is Ana Ikan Bakar Petai but my family prefers this one
3. Satay Zul - Best satay in town
4. Kam Loong Chicken Rice - best chicken rice and roast pork in town
5. Gerai Mok Naa - Delicious, freshly fried keropok lekor
6. Jaman Tory - Traditional Malay dishes like pekasam and ikan patin tempoyak is here, can order on Grabfood
7. Mek La - Kelantanese breakfast place selling laksam and nasi kerabu, this is a bit far and only accessible if you have transport
8. Hup Kee @ La Gourmet (in front of Public Bank) - Chinese yong tau foo with noodles and good coffee, can be a bit pricey but taste wise very consistent
9. On The Way Kopitiam - A new breakfast spot, this is a branch from Kuala Terengganu and features traditional dishes like laksa merah, a bit pricey and queue can be long
10. Pickers - A recent supper spot at Jalan Besar, serving local dishes and coffee, the decor is all about vintage items that Malaysians will definitely recognise

Have fun!

Edit: spelling || It's been years since I last visited kuantan, so not sure if these places still hold up. 

There's a noodle shop at teluk cempedak, Hoi Yin. I liked the curry mee.

Kula Cakes had a loooooong q when I went there. The mango cheesecake was the most recced item. There's outdoor seating has cute murals.

Someone told me that the cake is also available at this restaurant called Lila Wadi. I went there years and years but I honestly don't remember the food, so idk if I'd rec it. || ehmm.. coffee event in kuantan. Interesting (While I love coffee but I'm kinda waiting for Big Bad Wolf sale later in few weeks.). It's at East Coast Mall which is a food mall and located in a food-ish district here so you won't starve. I'm still trying out around the area, (for the mall itself, I've tried Banana Bros, Sushi King, Dolly Dim Sum and Dubuyo... it's practically what you usually get in Klang Valley) there's Vietnamese and Syrian food around too. 

Personally, I recommend the local east coast specialties if you can find them. Patin Tempoyak with Rice. Nasi Minyak with Ayam Masak Merah. Nasi Kerabu. Nasi Dagang. Keropok Lekor. Otak-otak. || mango cheesecake looks awesome. Cheers!"
