tale malaysian covid positive fadzil haji aziz yesterday public mcj covid journey assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit covid kes yang ke xxx saya rasa maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit covid mac jam malam saya dan ekhwan bertolak ke klia untuk memulakan perjalanan ke new york selama hari hanya kami berdua anak tak ikut sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke ny baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini mula memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni tapi rasa excited tu kadang melebihi rasa takut plus masa tu us belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi kami pun macam ala confident la nak pegi dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain lagi jadi kami pun pegi la jugak huh degei nooo anak mak niiiii mac sampai di jfk airport terus ke tempat penginapan di nd st nd avenue guna servis limo di airport mac mac memulakan acara jalan di nyc perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang patuh pada perjanjian selalu sanitizecuci tangan jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat jangan sentuh pintu kedaiescalator handrails rajin mandi jangan mengorat pelancong lain makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi mac mac saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam tekak rasa kering dan pedih sikit tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik pcm selepas hari saya sembuh tekak dah tak sakit demam dah hilang tapi dalam tempoh hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung lagi pun nyc dah start lockdown kami juga ada hubungi encik hanafi dari malaysia embassy di ny minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik dan call nyc covid hotline untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get line sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor mac dah baik demam tekak pun dah ok tapiiiiiiihilang deria bau dan deria rasa ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang takde batuk takde sakit dada mac mac travel balik ke malaysia sebelum balik kami book homestay dekat shah alam untuk minggu self quarantine taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi taknak risikokan anak mak mertua adik ipar jiran tetangga dan l lola lulu luna yang gebuuuuuu sampai klia ada screening kkm sebab kami tak demam jadi pegawai kkm bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine mac mulakan kuarantin di homestay ekhwan start demam dan batuk ajak pergi test dia kata takpe tunggu kejap lagi hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed weather je dia demam tu makan pcm sepanjang demam dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa selain buat kerja office dari rumah tengok crash landing awwwwkacak betul hyun bin mac pergi msu drive thru covid screening test reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test nasooropharynx swab sekejap je dah siap april pagi ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari lablink negative saya belum dapat saspen jugak ni sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari lablink puan yusneeda saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni puan bertenang ye ok dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap saya positive covid lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak kkm iaitu doctor dari pkd pejabat kesihatan daerah petaling akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke hospital sungai buloh murung sehari semalam penat ekhwan bagi kata semangat tapi saya tak layan haha yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif eh tapi kan dah demam masa kat ny april jam petang ambulance sampai abang kkm lengkap dengan ppe jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata semangat masuk ambulance tutup pintu nangissssssssssshaaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi gatai nak pi jugak kan dah kena dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak rindu anak tak mesti la rindu tapi saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak tak boleh mengeluh tanggungjawab itu penting sampai hospital terus ke ward b tukar baju mulakan prosedur doktor datang interview tanya sejarah perjalanan tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya part ni paling penting kena jujur sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain pada frontliners pada seluruh warga kkm pada masyarakat pada kerajaan malaysian yang awesome bodek sikit jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di nyc sendiri dan doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom yakni pada mac maka ketika saya tiba di hospital itu adalah hari ke saya bersama cik corona owh lupa nak cakap saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya penting syarikat saya bekerja memang ada special taskforce untuk manage hal berkaitan covid hai ridhuan hai farina selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor buat chest xray dan ambil darah check blood pressure body temperature dan oxygen level chest xray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak walaupun saya tak ada symptom menurut doctor itu adalah prosedur sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru jumpa kawan baru di ward n dan kl baik belaka siap ada whatsapp group dah dan follow di socmed april jam pagi doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test result mungkin dapat within hours ok doctor saya yang menurut perintah mean time teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss smell saya tak perlu makan apa ubat saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je habis pulak tu haha ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital sg buloh untuk buat test waktu saya tulis ni result masih belum dapat lagi april alhamdulillah latest result adalah negative jadi saya dibenarkan keluar dan wajib kuarantin diri lagi selama hari untuk pastikan saya betul bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang hari saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan pkd semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah tapi lagi sedih kalau apa terjadi pada keluarga saya jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin demi insan tersayang dan negara tercintatakpe kejap je hari tu jom layan money heist pulak sambil buat kerja itulah serba sikit kisah saya saya bersyukur kerana allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat sebagai seorang yang telah pulih saya sentiasa berdoa semoga allah swt memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit covid yang lain yang sedang berjuang saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih insya allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma semoga cepat sama dapat balik bersama keluarga perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan tersayang ni bukan main saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu tinggalkan anak percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan yang berhati mulia mengambil berat tabah ikhlas dan penyayang saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini jadi di kesempatan ini

tale malaysian covid positive fadzil haji aziz yesterday public mcj covid journey assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit covid kes yang ke xxx saya rasa maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit covid mac jam malam saya dan ekhwan bertolak ke klia untuk memulakan perjalanan ke new york selama hari hanya kami berdua anak tak ikut sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke ny baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini mula memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni tapi rasa excited tu kadang melebihi rasa takut plus masa tu us belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi kami pun macam ala confident la nak pegi dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain lagi jadi kami pun pegi la jugak huh degei nooo anak mak niiiii mac sampai di jfk airport terus ke tempat penginapan di nd st nd avenue guna servis limo di airport mac mac memulakan acara jalan di nyc perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang patuh pada perjanjian selalu sanitizecuci tangan jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat jangan sentuh pintu kedaiescalator handrails rajin mandi jangan mengorat pelancong lain makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi mac mac saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam tekak rasa kering dan pedih sikit tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik pcm selepas hari saya sembuh tekak dah tak sakit demam dah hilang tapi dalam tempoh hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung lagi pun nyc dah start lockdown kami juga ada hubungi encik hanafi dari malaysia embassy di ny minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik dan call nyc covid hotline untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get line sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor mac dah baik demam tekak pun dah ok tapiiiiiiihilang deria bau dan deria rasa ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang takde batuk takde sakit dada mac mac travel balik ke malaysia sebelum balik kami book homestay dekat shah alam untuk minggu self quarantine taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi taknak risikokan anak mak mertua adik ipar jiran tetangga dan l lola lulu luna yang gebuuuuuu sampai klia ada screening kkm sebab kami tak demam jadi pegawai kkm bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine mac mulakan kuarantin di homestay ekhwan start demam dan batuk ajak pergi test dia kata takpe tunggu kejap lagi hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed weather je dia demam tu makan pcm sepanjang demam dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa selain buat kerja office dari rumah tengok crash landing awwwwkacak betul hyun bin mac pergi msu drive thru covid screening test reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test nasooropharynx swab sekejap je dah siap april pagi ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari lablink negative saya belum dapat saspen jugak ni sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari lablink puan yusneeda saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni puan bertenang ye ok dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap saya positive covid lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak kkm iaitu doctor dari pkd pejabat kesihatan daerah petaling akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke hospital sungai buloh murung sehari semalam penat ekhwan bagi kata semangat tapi saya tak layan haha yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif eh tapi kan dah demam masa kat ny april jam petang ambulance sampai abang kkm lengkap dengan ppe jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata semangat masuk ambulance tutup pintu nangissssssssssshaaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi gatai nak pi jugak kan dah kena dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak rindu anak tak mesti la rindu tapi saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak tak boleh mengeluh tanggungjawab itu penting sampai hospital terus ke ward b tukar baju mulakan prosedur doktor datang interview tanya sejarah perjalanan tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya part ni paling penting kena jujur sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain pada frontliners pada seluruh warga kkm pada masyarakat pada kerajaan malaysian yang awesome bodek sikit jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di nyc sendiri dan doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom yakni pada mac maka ketika saya tiba di hospital itu adalah hari ke saya bersama cik corona owh lupa nak cakap saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya penting syarikat saya bekerja memang ada special taskforce untuk manage hal berkaitan covid hai ridhuan hai farina selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor buat chest xray dan ambil darah check blood pressure body temperature dan oxygen level chest xray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak walaupun saya tak ada symptom menurut doctor itu adalah prosedur sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru jumpa kawan baru di ward n dan kl baik belaka siap ada whatsapp group dah dan follow di socmed april jam pagi doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test result mungkin dapat within hours ok doctor saya yang menurut perintah mean time teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss smell saya tak perlu makan apa ubat saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je habis pulak tu haha ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital sg buloh untuk buat test waktu saya tulis ni result masih belum dapat lagi april alhamdulillah latest result adalah negative jadi saya dibenarkan keluar dan wajib kuarantin diri lagi selama hari untuk pastikan saya betul bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang hari saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan pkd semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah tapi lagi sedih kalau apa terjadi pada keluarga saya jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin demi insan tersayang dan negara tercintatakpe kejap je hari tu jom layan money heist pulak sambil buat kerja itulah serba sikit kisah saya saya bersyukur kerana allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat sebagai seorang yang telah pulih saya sentiasa berdoa semoga allah swt memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit covid yang lain yang sedang berjuang saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih insya allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma semoga cepat sama dapat balik bersama keluarga perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan tersayang ni bukan main saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu tinggalkan anak percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan yang berhati mulia mengambil berat tabah ikhlas dan penyayang saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini jadi di kesempatan ini

tale malaysian covid positive fadzil haji aziz yesterday public mcj covid journey assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit covid kes yang ke xxx saya rasa maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit covid mac jam malam saya dan ekhwan bertolak ke klia untuk memulakan perjalanan ke new york selama hari hanya kami berdua anak tak ikut sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke ny baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini mula memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni tapi rasa excited tu kadang melebihi rasa takut plus masa tu us belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi kami pun macam ala confident la nak pegi dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain lagi jadi kami pun pegi la jugak huh degei nooo anak mak niiiii mac sampai di jfk airport terus ke tempat penginapan di nd st nd avenue guna servis limo di airport mac mac memulakan acara jalan di nyc perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang patuh pada perjanjian selalu sanitizecuci tangan jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat jangan sentuh pintu kedaiescalator handrails rajin mandi jangan mengorat pelancong lain makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi mac mac saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam tekak rasa kering dan pedih sikit tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik pcm selepas hari saya sembuh tekak dah tak sakit demam dah hilang tapi dalam tempoh hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung lagi pun nyc dah start lockdown kami juga ada hubungi encik hanafi dari malaysia embassy di ny minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik dan call nyc covid hotline untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get line sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor mac dah baik demam tekak pun dah ok tapiiiiiiihilang deria bau dan deria rasa ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang takde batuk takde sakit dada mac mac travel balik ke malaysia sebelum balik kami book homestay dekat shah alam untuk minggu self quarantine taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi taknak risikokan anak mak mertua adik ipar jiran tetangga dan l lola lulu luna yang gebuuuuuu sampai klia ada screening kkm sebab kami tak demam jadi pegawai kkm bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine mac mulakan kuarantin di homestay ekhwan start demam dan batuk ajak pergi test dia kata takpe tunggu kejap lagi hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed weather je dia demam tu makan pcm sepanjang demam dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa selain buat kerja office dari rumah tengok crash landing awwwwkacak betul hyun bin mac pergi msu drive thru covid screening test reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test nasooropharynx swab sekejap je dah siap april pagi ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari lablink negative saya belum dapat saspen jugak ni sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari lablink puan yusneeda saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni puan bertenang ye ok dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap saya positive covid lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak kkm iaitu doctor dari pkd pejabat kesihatan daerah petaling akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke hospital sungai buloh murung sehari semalam penat ekhwan bagi kata semangat tapi saya tak layan haha yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif eh tapi kan dah demam masa kat ny april jam petang ambulance sampai abang kkm lengkap dengan ppe jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata semangat masuk ambulance tutup pintu nangissssssssssshaaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi gatai nak pi jugak kan dah kena dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak rindu anak tak mesti la rindu tapi saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak tak boleh mengeluh tanggungjawab itu penting sampai hospital terus ke ward b tukar baju mulakan prosedur doktor datang interview tanya sejarah perjalanan tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya part ni paling penting kena jujur sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain pada frontliners pada seluruh warga kkm pada masyarakat pada kerajaan malaysian yang awesome bodek sikit jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di nyc sendiri dan doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom yakni pada mac maka ketika saya tiba di hospital itu adalah hari ke saya bersama cik corona owh lupa nak cakap saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya penting syarikat saya bekerja memang ada special taskforce untuk manage hal berkaitan covid hai ridhuan hai farina selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor buat chest xray dan ambil darah check blood pressure body temperature dan oxygen level chest xray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak walaupun saya tak ada symptom menurut doctor itu adalah prosedur sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru jumpa kawan baru di ward n dan kl baik belaka siap ada whatsapp group dah dan follow di socmed april jam pagi doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test result mungkin dapat within hours ok doctor saya yang menurut perintah mean time teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss smell saya tak perlu makan apa ubat saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je habis pulak tu haha ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital sg buloh untuk buat test waktu saya tulis ni result masih belum dapat lagi april alhamdulillah latest result adalah negative jadi saya dibenarkan keluar dan wajib kuarantin diri lagi selama hari untuk pastikan saya betul bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang hari saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan pkd semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah tapi lagi sedih kalau apa terjadi pada keluarga saya jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin demi insan tersayang dan negara tercintatakpe kejap je hari tu jom layan money heist pulak sambil buat kerja itulah serba sikit kisah saya saya bersyukur kerana allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat sebagai seorang yang telah pulih saya sentiasa berdoa semoga allah swt memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit covid yang lain yang sedang berjuang saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih insya allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma semoga cepat sama dapat balik bersama keluarga perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan tersayang ni bukan main saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu tinggalkan anak percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan yang berhati mulia mengambil berat tabah ikhlas dan penyayang saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini jadi di kesempatan ini juga saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya terima kasih yang tidak terhingga semoga allahswt sentiasa merahmati kalian semua jutaan
