Is this normal?,Bought the Popcorn Chicken+Fries+Lemonade from Pop Meals (via foodpanda) for RM13.99. The fries portion is barely a scoop and 80% of em are small 😭.

Foodpanda Bicycle Rider Question,"Greetings all,

I am looking for specific insight on Foodpanda Bicycle rider. 

Anyone with inside knowledge on how this works or first hand experience would be appreciated.

I am referring to Foodpanda riders that specifically ride manual bicycles (not electric bicycle or scooter), as I have seen some of those before.

My question is how does this works exactly? In terms of how Foodpanda side assign jobs to those on bicycles seeing that if the job given is too far then it would be too impractical for them to pick up and drop off the order in a timely manner seeing that bicycle is not exactly designed to travel fast in long distances.

The reason I asked is I am pondering to try it myself but just wondering how it works before commiting to it.","Hi I used to do  foodpanda walker during mco. you need apply for foodpanda walker option when applying to them.

Foodpanda wants you to BEG for refunds,"I know there are still a lot of Foodpanda users out here despite of their not so pleasant experiences when things go wrong on their orders. I am sharing this post as a tip to everyone so that you are aware of the current situation of things especially new users who doesn't have a clue. Here goes the list.. 

1.) They DON'T REFUND for OUT OF STOCK items paid by CASH VOUCHERS (lazada or shoppee). 
Their system only sees it as you are not maximizing the voucher value. YOUR LOSS = PROFIT TO THEM

Example buy 3 bottle of nescafe coffee but 1 bottle is out of stock. That out of stock is considered burn/forfeited from the original cash voucher and won't be refunded. Next time you want to order, make sure you go to the store and get confirmation from the store manager whether they have stock first before you order anything. 

2.) Customer service is non existent. 
Impossible to get live chat with live human agent. Suspect that all is running on AI chatbots which can spew scripted replies and close your ticket within 10 minutes or less. 

In the past, it is still possible to get a refund for 1.) because human agents are not mindless bots. 

3.) Facebook admin suspected to be a chatbot as well
The admin is always online and replies to your posts/comments with multiple language support and scripted replies very promptly. It is capable of deleting comments and also ban users who are CRITICAL about their services as well. In order words, your NEGATIVE posts on their Facebook would be deleted and you would be BANNED as a damage control if you continously comment on their poor services

4.) Reporting to KPDN / tribunal is not worth due to the small claim amount 
You still have to attend the tribunal hearing at their office and incur time cost by taking leave from work, parking, petrol, transport charges, etc. They know this so they would IGNORE KPDN threats from customers.

5.).... Feel free to continue from hereband add to this post about your BAD EXPERIENCE with them.

The objective is to remind everyone not to waste anymore time using their services as they wouldn't even care if you have to BEG them for REFUNDS or raise your blood pressures in doing so. In their perception, they have so much of customers that losing a few doesn't even make a dent in their profits.","Stop using foodpanda, shoppeefood is currently the best on the market. || Deleted the app right after pandemic. Faced various issues and had to follow up emails after emails for refunds and include so many justifications for their own mistake. Haven’t been using for almost 4 years!

However, if you live in Klang Valley you have alternatives, some outskirt folks only have this app as main food delivery. As much as Grab also has issues, it sucks lesser than FP 

The app sucks
The promo sucks
The CS sucks || I ordered dominoes, the app says its still on the way after an hour, we got fed up waiting. Turns out the app was frozen on the driver delivering screen, even after we refreshed it, we called dominoes, they didn’t end up delivering the food. We went to the actual store (we should’ve prob drove there in first place but I wanted to surprise my sis and bro in law since they are exhausted from work) and walla, our food was there at the back of the kitchen.

The workers there are like, we thought it was cancelled but you can still pick them up now? I was soo confused and pissed. But then I knew I’d be getting some cold ass pizzas if I took it, so a 80RM refund sounds more delicious. I didn’t take it and kept calling foodpanda and got the refund.

This is during the time I first started working and couldn’t get a cc so I was using debit.

Deleted the app after the refund. Never gone back to FP, not worth it. That is 3 years ago. 😊 || When you order food on foodpanda, there is an option on what to do if the item is out of stock. The default setting is ‘remove from my order’, but you can also choose ‘call me’ or ‘cancel the whole order’. 

Obviously the call me option is best, but if you choose ‘cancel the whole order’, your voucher will be returned to your foodpanda wallet. 

Granted, I only use foodpanda for food delivery, so I’m not sure if they have this option for grocery delivery. 

Also, I usually use the chat feature for problems with my delivery (food spilled, missing items etc) and usually get good resolutions. I mean, they usually refund the cost of the food item, I’m not asking them for more than the food cost. 

So I will take that voucher and use it for my next orders. (I usually ask for vouchers, not for refunds on my credit card. The money is already out of my account.. so the voucher is ‘free’ #GirlMath) || 4) credit card chargeback - I was successful. || Hahahah

Shoutout to the Amazing Grab and Foodpanda Abang Riders! 231124,"
Just want to give a shoutout to two abang riders near Batu Tiga today, at two separate chaotic traffic junctions where the lights were completely out, these two abang riders, one from Grab and one from Foodpanda, stepped up as heroes! Without hesitation, they became traffic controllers, directing vehicles with such a calm and systematic approach.

I don’t know how long they had been at it, but I watched them for about 15–20 minutes, and they were working tirelessly to ensure everything ran smoothly. They didn’t have to do it, but they chose to help, and it made such a huge difference. It was so heartwarming to see their dedication and effort to help out. It’s a reminder of the good in people.

Massive respect to these abang riders, true unsung heroes of the day!

Isu jalan di kawasan pandamas ampang,"Assalamualaikum.. gambar yang diatas ni gambar yang lepas laa yang lama.. ambil dalam googlemap dan masa ni tempat sembahyang india pun tak ada lagi. Okay baik saya nak cerita.

5 September 2024 dimana tempat sembahyang india telah menghalang sebahagian jalan utama lalu lalang apartment pandamans. Diorang bina khemas tempat sembahyang tak kisah tapi tolong jadi bijak dan matang dalam mengaturkan susunan jalan key?. Okay itu masalah pertama, Ini bukan kes besar. Masa ni aku tengah bawa foodpanda dan dalam masa sama lalu di jalan tersebut dan mendapati terdapat kesesakan lalu lintas yang agak sesak jugak laa.. nak jadikan cerita aku pun pergi la ke tempat sembahyang diorang dan tegur berkaitan sesak jalan dan MENCADANGKAN letak orang untuk kawal trafik.. trafik yang aku maksudkan ni bukan jalan sampai 2 ke 3 cabang.. cuma 1 cabang je arus pergi dan balik (sehala) dan banyak orang parking kiri kanan (penghuni pandamas) dan jugak jalan tu bukan jalan raya besar yang sambung negeri² penting.. selepas aku tegur dengan biasa nada baik dan genttle tiba² seorang kawan india ni bangun dan dekati aku seolah² macam nak ajak gaduh sambil berkata ""u dari mana? Haa u dari mana?"" Diikuti dengan seorang lagi kawan india pun berkata ""berapa lama u stay sini"".. aku pun jawap baru 1 bulan macam tu n salah satu kawan dia pun jawap ""u baru 1 bulan bla bla bla.. ini tempat sembahyang kami.. kwasan kami.. tempat sembahyang kami.."" aku diam dah pergi dari situ. Okay u all.. nak tanya baik².. aku tanya berkaitan jalan n cadangan tapi kenapa dia balas macam tu? Kemudian cara dia mulakan perbualan bukan dengan nada marah semata² tapi dengan keadaan yang menginginkan ketegangan (gaduh). Adakah saya berkata begitu telah menyinggung, menghina, mempersendakan, mempermainkan, memperendahkan agama dia?. Memang waktu ni aku nak rakam tapi tak pasal² dia hanyun sesuatu dekat aku jadi aku terus berlalu.

5 September 2024 dimana tempat sembahyang india telah menghalang sebahagian jalan utama lalu lalang apartment pandamans. Diorang bina khemas tempat sembahyang tak kisah tapi tolong jadi bijak dan matang dalam mengaturkan susunan jalan key?. Okay itu masalah pertama, Ini bukan kes besar. Masa ni aku tengah bawa foodpanda dan dalam masa sama lalu di jalan tersebut dan mendapati terdapat kesesakan lalu lintas yang agak sesak jugak laa.. nak jadikan cerita aku pun pergi la ke tempat sembahyang diorang dan tegur berkaitan sesak jalan dan MENCADANGKAN letak orang untuk kawal trafik.. trafik yang aku maksudkan ni bukan jalan sampai 2 ke 3 cabang.. cuma 1 cabang je arus pergi dan balik (sehala) dan banyak orang parking kiri kanan (penghuni pandamas) dan jugak jalan tu bukan jalan raya besar yang sambung negeri² penting.. selepas aku tegur dengan biasa nada baik dan genttle tiba² seorang kawan india ni bangun dan dekati aku seolah² macam nak ajak gaduh sambil berkata ""u dari mana? Haa u dari mana?"" Diikuti dengan seorang lagi kawan india pun berkata ""berapa lama u stay sini"".. aku pun jawap baru 1 bulan macam tu n salah satu kawan dia pun jawap ""u baru 1 bulan bla bla bla.. ini tempat sembahyang kami.. kwasan kami.. tempat sembahyang kami.."" aku diam dah pergi dari situ. Okay u all.. nak tanya baik².. aku tanya berkaitan jalan n cadangan tapi kenapa dia balas macam tu? Kemudian cara dia mulakan perbualan bukan dengan nada marah semata² tapi dengan keadaan yang menginginkan ketegangan (gaduh). Adakah saya berkata begitu telah menyinggung, menghina, mempersendakan, mempermainkan, memperendahkan agama dia?. Memang waktu ni aku nak rakam tapi tak pasal² dia hanyun sesuatu dekat aku jadi aku terus berlalu. Nanti ada masa aku ambil gambar dikawasan situ. ","The issue of the road in the Pandamas Ampang area Assalamualaikum .. The picture above is the last picture .. Take it in the googlemap and this time is no more Indian prayer. Okay well I want to tell you.

September 5, 2024 where the Indian prayer area prevents some of the main roads from the Pandamans Apartment. Build a khemas place of prayer no matter what but please be wise and mature in organizing the Key Road? Okay that's the first problem, this is not a big case. This time I was carrying a foodpanda and in the same time on the road and found that there was a traffic jam that was a bit crowded .. I wanted to tell my story to go to the place of prayer and to say about the road and suggested people to control traffic .. the traffic I meant was not 2 to 3 branches .. just 1 branch of the road (one -way) The important states .. after I told you used to be a good tone and genttle suddenly an Indian friend got up and approached me as if to invite and say ""where are you from? Haa u from?"" Followed by another Indian friend said ""how long do you stay here"" .. I answered just 1 month like that one of his friends answered ""u just 1 month blah blah blah .. this is our prayer place .. our prayer .. our prayer place .."" I was quiet. Okay u all .. Want to ask good .. I asked about the path of proposal but why did he respond like that? Then the way he started the conversation was not alone in anger but with a state of tension. Do I say that has been offended, insulted, ridiculed, mocked, underestimated his religion?. It was time for me to record but I didn't know something near me so I kept going. There will be times when I take pictures in the area.",issue road pandamas ampang area assalamualaikum picture last picture take googlemap time indian prayer okay well want tell september indian prayer area prevents main roads pandamans apartment build khemas place prayer matter please wise mature organizing key road okay thats first problem big case time carrying foodpanda time road found traffic jam bit crowded wanted tell story go place prayer say road suggested people control traffic traffic meant branches branch road one way important states told used good tone genttle suddenly indian friend got approached invite say haa u followed another indian friend said long stay answered month like one friends answered u month blah blah blah prayer place prayer prayer place quiet okay u want ask good asked path proposal respond like way started conversation alone anger state tension say offended insulted ridiculed mocked underestimated religion time record didnt know something near kept going times take pictures area,False,"['issue', 'road', 'panda', '##mas', 'amp', '##ang', 'area', 'ass', '##ala', '##mu', '##ala', '##ik', '##um', 'picture', 'last', 'picture', 'take', 'google', '##ma', '##p', 'time', 'indian', 'prayer', 'okay', 'well', 'want', 'tell', 'september', 'indian', 'prayer', 'area', 'prevents', 'main', 'roads', 'panda', '##mans', 'apartment', 'build', 'k', '##hema', '##s', 'place', 'prayer', 'matter', 'please', 'wise', 'mature', 'organizing', 'key', 'road', 'okay', 'that', '##s', 'first', 'problem', 'big', 'case', 'time', 'carrying', 'food', '##pan', '##da', 'time', 'road', 'found', 'traffic', 'jam', 'bit', 'crowded', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'go', 'place', 'prayer', 'say', 'road', 'suggested', 'people', 'control', 'traffic', 'traffic', 'meant', 'branches', 'branch', 'road', 'one', 'way', 'important', 'states', 'told', 'used', 'good', 'tone', 'gen', '##ttle', 'suddenly', 'indian', 'friend', 'got', 'approached', 'invite', 'say', 'ha', '##a', 'u', 'followed', 'another', 'indian', 'friend', 'said', 'long', 'stay', 'answered', 'month', 'like', 'one', 'friends', 'answered', 'u', 'month', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'prayer', 'place', 'prayer', 'prayer', 'place', 'quiet', 'okay', 'u', 'want', 'ask', 'good', 'asked', 'path', 'proposal', 'respond', 'like', 'way', 'started', 'conversation', 'alone', 'anger', 'state', 'tension', 'say', 'offended', 'insulted', 'rid', '##ic', '##uled', 'mocked', 'under', '##est', '##imated', 'religion', 'time', 'record', 'didn', '##t', 'know', 'something', 'near', 'kept', 'going', 'times', 'take', 'pictures', 'area']",foodpanda

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order) I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas. 

","I think it's mainly got to do with the law where if a motorcycle gets into an accident with a car, regardless of who's actually at fault, the car driver has to lay up || Ah yes, contribute to self bashing. Then again i did choose to ride i suppose.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

And then channel these redundant people to work on something else. || Unfortunately, because we practice a racialist political system, every problem is seen with racial lenses.

So even if we know how to fix the problems with law breaking motorcyclists, there is very little political will to do it.

Most law breaking motorcyclists are identified as coming from a particular race. This means that politicians who are self-proclaimed champions of this race will defend them till the cows come home.

Beware of the TNG RM5 for RM120 Voucher Pack Scam!,"[Voucherpack\_June\_webbanner.png](https://preview.redd.it/mmja1gwe8g7d1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=697650458b9752541c61f26afcef564b3322127c)

I just fell for what I believe is a misleading promotion by Touch 'n Go (TNG) eWallet, and I want to warn others before they waste their money. Here’s what happened:

# The ""Deal""

TNG is running an ad in their eWallet app promising RM120 worth of vouchers for just RM5. Sounds amazing, right? I thought so too and quickly paid the RM5.

# The Reality

After paying, I received ELEVEN (11) vouchers, but here’s the catch that wasn't clearly communicated upfront:

* **Minimum Spend Requirements:** Each voucher requires a minimum spend to be usable. For example:
   * RM8 Prepaid Voucher requires a RM60 top-up.
   * RM6 Foodpanda Voucher requires a RM100 purchase.
   * RM40 CarInsure Voucher requires a RM600 insurance premium.
* **Short Validity Periods:** Most vouchers are only valid for 5 days, making it nearly impossible to use them unless you were already planning to spend a lot within that short timeframe.

# Misleading Marketing

The initial ad conveniently omits these crucial details, only revealing them deep in the terms and conditions. This kind of hidden information feels incredibly deceptive and preys on users looking for a good deal.

# Final Thoughts

It’s really frustrating to see such tactics. RM5 might not seem like much, but it’s the principle of being tricked that really stings.

Stay cautious, everyone!

[https://www.facebook.com/share/p/8vseLdZshEQCSZ9y/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/8vseLdZshEQCSZ9y/) What does food panda have to do with this? Half the riders just grab the bag without checking properly sometimes. Food panda is just connecting buyer to seller.

Don't need to start business in Malaysia anymore. Always wanted to but if I really do plan to go ahead, maybe in another country. || But was the babi good though? || Lucky. They got to taste babi without being sinful since it's not intentional. || What's the title supposed to imply?

The rider obviously made a mistake. It's not the first time this has happened and it won't be the last, given how food delivery services began the practice of stacking multiple deliveries on the same rider at a time years ago. || Got char kuey teow without the char once from FoodPanda. || Obviously riders fault, I also have received mcd beef burger when I order chicken burger (rider send wrong order not mcd). 

Or recvd neighbours order when I didn’t order anything. || The rider must be doing multiple orders at the same time. Once the rider came with multiple orders and took the wrong bag for me. Luckily I was his first stop and the other order was from a different place and can see through plastic what was the food.

For this case, if it's so important, you as parents should've ensured everything is right for your kids to consume. Mak sibuk online class, bapak order pas tu pi mana? Attend online class mak? Delivery rider may be at fault but you're equally at fault too. FB comment asking to saman on what basis 😂 rider Kasi salah makanan, ibu sibuk, bapak hilang lepas buat order, pastu anak termakan babi? || It's a string of error from Foodpanda to the receiving customer, but die die also wanna blame and boikot Foodpanda, a company which is employing a few villages of type M riders... 

Just that night I received a wrong delivery of a birthday cake. The driver was correct because he just followed the address, but we called him back and he did come to re-collect the cake though he didn't know where to deliver it next. Shows that if customers do their part to check the items, the problem wouldn't have escalated until then consuming non-halal items. But they clearly mentioned that they didn't check and went on to point fingers immediately. || What a bunch of old faks degenerate in FB comments || Ah yes, the Mee Kari Kedai Ah-Hok.

What Can Outsider do When Friend is Being Abused by Her Parent?,"Sorry if my England isn't that good but I'm trying to help my friend but I am not good with Laws and Police Enforcement.. 

This is going to be a long story to this situation, I have a friend who is now 25, Female. She is living with her brother, and mother. We were friends since middle school and roughly 2 - 3 years ago. Her father passed away, and us (friend group) have been finding some weird things happening in her family. 

She has to work a full time job and go home to cook, clean, the house daily. And sometimes even until 10PM she told us she had to clean the house before sleep.(Had to sleep late until her older brother finishes his meal and wash his dishes). Her mother is unemployed and roughly at the age of 40+. And have been asking my friend to do all the house chores while mother do nothing.

  
Her mother has been fetching them to work daily and never allowed them to drive. They have 2 cars and one was new (bought by brother but the mother wants daughter to pay some). And we noticed some strange interaction with her family about 2 or 3 years ago (After fathers passing).

We went out for friend dinner to celebrate her birthday, 6PM. Her mother called her and scolded her for not ordering food for them (mom and brother). We asked cant his brother order foodpands? She told us ""AIyah, my brother doesn't know how to use these apps"". We were shocked, as the mother called her not just once, but THREE times during that day just to constantly rush her to order foodpanda over to them. 

Soon after when we were all slowly living our lives (work, graduation, away from hometown). She is starting to struggle to look for a job, which then my sister recommended her a new job position. She finally started having a stable social life and even got herself a boyfriend! We were so happy for her because we thought she might finally be able to move out from home. And this is where everything goes down.

Another day us friend group meet up we noticed her hand is having serious skin issues (gotten worse). And she told us its due to chemicals from the dish soap. And until now it has never been cured. We told her to stop washing plates or maybe wear gloves but she is not doing it. Fast forward to where she was dating.  The boyfriend bought her a dishwasher. But the mother was very pissed off about it. Saying that ""My daughter can do it why do we need this?"" The boyfriend explained it to the mother and she wasn't pleased about it. And slowly pressuring the daughter. Whenever they went out on a date and come back home before 10PM. the mother would scream at her and boyfriend. Scolding them and insulting them. Forcing them to break up. And that stopped them from going out on a date (Must bring the mother along).  


Soon after the mother knowing that it wont separate them. She started to blame my sister (And the company) By going to the company front door and scream. Saying they ""changed"" her daughter. Until they have to call the police. Soon after the mother never bring her to work. Threw her alone on the roadside and drove off. One day the mother said she is bringing her to work. But ended up going to her relatives house, and to the boyfriends house to fight with them. And to really make them break up, the mother beat her everyday after work until they willing to breakup. They ended up broken up. 

  
Today she didn't go to work again. She was locked at home and got beaten up by her mother again. The boss from the office never fired her because they want to help her. But does not know how. They wanted to call the police but are afraid she might have no where to stay after all that happened.  I am wondering what can we do as an outsider to help her, we tried talking to her for years but nothing has changed. This time it went too far and the police thing makes everyone worried if it will ruin her future... Anyone here have similar issues of living with an abusive family? How do you get out from it? How would you resolve this issue?","I would definitely report this abuse to the police. Your friend would be better off on her own if her family is taking advantage of her like this. Your friend deserves better. 

Also I respect your care and concern and it shows your upstanding character. || Right, okay, where do I begin. 

The Women's Aid Organisation has a lot of good resources for this, including this portion addressed to people who believe their friend may be suffering from domestic violence: 

What you can do
- Listen to your friend and do not judge. Assure them that the abuse isn’t their fault.
- Ask your friend what they would like to do and respect their choices.
- Share with them the WAO Hotline (+603 3000 8858) or SMS/WhatsApp line (018 988 8058).
- If your friend would like to take action, you can accompany them to the police station to make a police report.
- If your friend is injured and wants medical care, you can accompany them to the “One Stop Crisis Centre” located in the emergency room of government hospitals.
- If you are unsure how to respond, you can call us at +603 3000 8858 or SMS/WhatsApp 018 988 8058 for guidance.

Their website is http://wao.org.my and I would suggest familiarising yourself with their content too, so you can supply assistance to your friend if/when she seeks it. 

There are legal recourses- the Malaysian Domestic Violence Act doesn't just cover violence committed against a spouse, but also against an adult family member. If your friend chooses, a court protection order could restrict her mother from entering her place of residence, work, or coming within 50 metres of her. If a court decides there is a risk of a violent contravention of the protection order, it could also attach an arrest order to it, meaning if her mother does violate the protection order she would be arrested. The WAO also runs shelters for domestic violence survivors and can advise on all of this in more detail. 

On a personal level as someone who has experience of the abusive cycle, it is down to your friend to make the decision to leave. But she may feel like she has no choice and no options, which is where you can come in to assist with the options I've detailed above. However, escaping the abuser is only the start of the battle- pressure on survivors to brush abuse aside and ""not air dirty laundry"" is strong. It is vital that your friend, if she chooses to make this change, receive support both from mental help professionals as well as from like-minded communities, so that she doesn't get drawn back into her abusers' orbit. 

On a personal note, I keep a folder of my abusers' messages to show anyone who tries to tell me ""it wasn't that bad"" or to minimise my experience. It's a reasonably effective way to get people to shut up about what they know nothing about. || Seems like a classic case of abuse and the victim very docile. She has a job, her workplace wants to help her, she is financially independent. She can literally just walk away. Its up to her to choose. || Thank you for all the suggestions and Ideas. Fortunately the boss from her work company decided to call the police. She is now at the police station but that is all the information i got. (I'm not around her area) 

So far telling her to move out or be ""independent"" doesn't work at all. We have been trying to tell her that for years and whenever we say that she just ignores all of our messages. 

We soon understand that she is actually afraid. She once said ""If i ever stand up for myself, i might not have any family to go back to anymore""
I strongly believe she is afraid of losing her family and no one to lean on etc, which I can somehow understand since she grew up having little friends and always has to stay home. It's like how some parents will always brainwash their kids saying ""No one treats you better like your family"" Idealogy which so we all stopped telling her that and told her it was all up to her from now. and we said that last year... So it's been so long and things just got worse. || Video tape (as a records evidence in the future), as police wont do shit. The old mother not gonna change.   

The best, get out and living totally out of touch with the family, however, this required temporarily financial aid/ loan + strong determination. Have to move out and stabilize, plan it perfectly, get all personal belongings and documents and run.

The house is inhabitable in a human perspective, police not gonna solve it verbally with the mom, jail is unlikely too. || [removed] || I always wonder if the girl is their own daughther for cases like this.

I mean, do they kidnapped some random baby girl from hospital 2 decades ago that they have the ability mistreated the girl?

Like baby elephant that forever thinking the piece of chain is sufficient to trap them for eternity.

I bet she has been abused since eon and unable to think that she can escape just by calling the police. 

It is already at this stage, I don't think she has the ability to break the chain herself. I mean, she has already working, had boyfriend etc but she never able to do tiny rebellion at home. 

If you know neighbour that can record incidents that they witness, would that help in this kind of cases? || You can't change anything for her.. Only she can decide to move out and block them || As hard as it is, I would recommend you guys as a group of friends (and her boyfriend) get her out of the house if you can (without breaking any laws of course)  and get her to cut off contact. It won’t be easy especially for her, but as long as she is under her mum’s thumb, your friend will never get the freedom she needs. 

Strangely, my GF has a friend in a similar situation with an abusive mother. She works in a big furniture retail store and is forced by her mother to give her money from her salary and to do all the chores and gets regularly abused. Unfortunately, it seems to have affected her confidence so she’s stuck in an endless loop with her mother which is a shame because my GF always thought she was really talented and could do way more but is being stopped by her own mother || Brother I feel you but the first step is that she has to be willing to get out. From the sound of her family, it looks like she's better on her own. As to who would be willing to take her in, short term can't you look into temporary living situation with renting first?

What I'm concerned about reading this is that you guys seems to want to help, but if you have already talked to her for years, and she's not receptive of help, then it's all moot. Try to see if she actually wants out or not, what her worries are about leaving her current toxic environment, and take it step by step to see what can you do to help.

This time it went too far and the police thing makes everyone worried if it will ruin her future... Anyone here have similar issues of living with an abusive family? How do you get out from it? How would you resolve this issue? I would definitely report this abuse to the police. Your friend would be better off on her own if her family is taking advantage of her like this. Your friend deserves better. 

Also I respect your care and concern and it shows your upstanding character. || Right, okay, where do I begin. 

The Women's Aid Organisation has a lot of good resources for this, including this portion addressed to people who believe their friend may be suffering from domestic violence: 

What you can do
- Listen to your friend and do not judge. Assure them that the abuse isn’t their fault.
- Ask your friend what they would like to do and respect their choices.
- Share with them the WAO Hotline (+603 3000 8858) or SMS/WhatsApp line (018 988 8058).
- If your friend would like to take action, you can accompany them to the police station to make a police report.
- If your friend is injured and wants medical care, you can accompany them to the “One Stop Crisis Centre” located in the emergency room of government hospitals.
- If you are unsure how to respond, you can call us at +603 3000 8858 or SMS/WhatsApp 018 988 8058 for guidance.

Their website is http://wao.org.my and I would suggest familiarising yourself with their content too, so you can supply assistance to your friend if/when she seeks it. 

There are legal recourses- the Malaysian Domestic Violence Act doesn't just cover violence committed against a spouse, but also against an adult family member. If your friend chooses, a court protection order could restrict her mother from entering her place of residence, work, or coming within 50 metres of her. If a court decides there is a risk of a violent contravention of the protection order, it could also attach an arrest order to it, meaning if her mother does violate the protection order she would be arrested. The WAO also runs shelters for domestic violence survivors and can advise on all of this in more detail. 

On a personal level as someone who has experience of the abusive cycle, it is down to your friend to make the decision to leave. But she may feel like she has no choice and no options, which is where you can come in to assist with the options I've detailed above. However, escaping the abuser is only the start of the battle- pressure on survivors to brush abuse aside and ""not air dirty laundry"" is strong. It is vital that your friend, if she chooses to make this change, receive support both from mental help professionals as well as from like-minded communities, so that she doesn't get drawn back into her abusers' orbit. 

On a personal note, I keep a folder of my abusers' messages to show anyone who tries to tell me ""it wasn't that bad"" or to minimise my experience. It's a reasonably effective way to get people to shut up about what they know nothing about. || Seems like a classic case of abuse and the victim very docile. She has a job, her workplace wants to help her, she is financially independent. She can literally just walk away. Its up to her to choose. || Thank you for all the suggestions and Ideas. Fortunately the boss from her work company decided to call the police. She is now at the police station but that is all the information i got. (I'm not around her area) 

So far telling her to move out or be ""independent"" doesn't work at all. We have been trying to tell her that for years and whenever we say that she just ignores all of our messages. 

We soon understand that she is actually afraid. She once said ""If i ever stand up for myself, i might not have any family to go back to anymore""
I strongly believe she is afraid of losing her family and no one to lean on etc, which I can somehow understand since she grew up having little friends and always has to stay home. It's like how some parents will always brainwash their kids saying ""No one treats you better like your family"" Idealogy which so we all stopped telling her that and told her it was all up to her from now. and we said that last year... So it's been so long and things just got worse. || Video tape (as a records evidence in the future), as police wont do shit. The old mother not gonna change.   

The best, get out and living totally out of touch with the family, however, this required temporarily financial aid/ loan + strong determination. Have to move out and stabilize, plan it perfectly, get all personal belongings and documents and run.

The house is inhabitable in a human perspective, police not gonna solve it verbally with the mom, jail is unlikely too. || [removed] || I always wonder if the girl is their own daughther for cases like this.

I mean, do they kidnapped some random baby girl from hospital 2 decades ago that they have the ability mistreated the girl?

Like baby elephant that forever thinking the piece of chain is sufficient to trap them for eternity.

I bet she has been abused since eon and unable to think that she can escape just by calling the police. 

It is already at this stage, I don't think she has the ability to break the chain herself. I mean, she has already working, had boyfriend etc but she never able to do tiny rebellion at home. 

If you know neighbour that can record incidents that they witness, would that help in this kind of cases? || You can't change anything for her.. Only she can decide to move out and block them || As hard as it is, I would recommend you guys as a group of friends (and her boyfriend) get her out of the house if you can (without breaking any laws of course)  and get her to cut off contact. It won’t be easy especially for her, but as long as she is under her mum’s thumb, your friend will never get the freedom she needs. 

Strangely, my GF has a friend in a similar situation with an abusive mother. She works in a big furniture retail store and is forced by her mother to give her money from her salary and to do all the chores and gets regularly abused. Unfortunately, it seems to have affected her confidence so she’s stuck in an endless loop with her mother which is a shame because my GF always thought she was really talented and could do way more but is being stopped by her own mother || Brother I feel you but the first step is that she has to be willing to get out. From the sound of her family, it looks like she's better on her own. As to who would be willing to take her in, short term can't you look into temporary living situation with renting first?

What I'm concerned about reading this is that you guys seems to want to help, but if you have already talked to her for years, and she's not receptive of help, then it's all moot. Try to see if she actually wants out or not, what her worries are about leaving her current toxic environment, and take it step by step to see what can you do to help.

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse

Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

Foodpanda Refunds,"Hey all! i figured i’d come here for advice.

I ordered food through foodpanda this morning and the restaurant called me saying their items were out of stock. Then proceeded to cancel the order and they agreed. Foodpanda agent then called me saying that they will not refund me considering the restaurant has prepared my order. I proceeded to tell the agent that the restaurant themselves told me they were out of stock, how could have they prepared it? And then the agent told me to claim through the app and she will refund it for me. I have then tried to talk to live agents and two different agents told me i am not able to be refunded considering the restaurant has already prepared the food and it’s a waste. To confirm their statement, i called the restaurant if they have prepared it and they said they didnt prepare anything. I’m at a loss and pretty upset that this happened. Any advice would really be helpful and appreciated deeply.

Sincerely,
A broke college student","Email them again with all the details and timeline, but this time u cc kpdnhep || Yeah, next time use other delivery services. GrabFood customer service is great, and refunds you less than 30mins. However, highly expensive and grabfoodunlimited deals are actually limited.

My collegue uses ShopeeFood a lot and its super cheap compared to GrabFood if you compare the same store prices. In addition, if you are familiar with Shopee's coupon discount, there are tons of it in ShopeeFood. We usually buy bulk for lunch in office and got discount up to rm30! I don't have any experience with ShopeeFood CS so can't comment on that. || not the first time I saw complaints about foodpanda customer service, just avoid using them next time.

I avoided foodpanda since they outsource their agents, who have no idea what they are doing at all. Solely used grabfood, refund process takes 5-10 mins only after submitting claim. Their customer service also local people, with proper english. || I stopped ordering from Foodpanda. Always GrabFood.

Twice, I have ordered at a restaurant that is still available in GrabFood but they are actually closed permanently. I cancelled my order and got my money back. || Report to kpdnkk, don't waste time with those stupid foodpanda cs || Hey OP, I've previously faced issues with foodpanda before. Pretty much just file a complain to  kpdnhep and they will handle the rest for you. I was contacted by foodpanda CS team after about 3 weeks, issued me a refund + a voucher || Foodpanda is the worst for getting refunds. Even if you get a valid refund (like food damaged, I kena they deliver so bad drink spillage all over my food) they will nickel and dime you. Meanwhile Grab will just terus give you the refund as long as can provide the pics and stuff. So I always go grab now since a few months back.

Not to mention foodpanda some of the deals and offers won't apply to you or they will just hide from your account. Really waste of time and money. The deals and offers look really good la which is why it is appealing but really not worth it in the long run everytime got issues. || Did you initiate the cancellation or did the restaurant initiate the cancellation? || Pernah order makanan tapi tak sampai masa pkp dulu. Chat dengan CS, the first guy kata makanan dah sampai tak boleh refund etc., then left probably because he ended his shift or something idk, and another person replace the guy (can see the name of operator changed) lepastu explain balik, and this new operator start refunding my money, took about 7 working days iirc. 

Conclusion: tengok nasib || The restaurant itself can cancel the order but nah they just throw it back to you.",10/1/2024,51,24.0,1704859325,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/192z1fp/foodpanda_refunds/,"Foodpanda Refunds Hey all! i figured i’d come here for advice.

A broke college student Email them again with all the details and timeline, but this time u cc kpdnhep || Yeah, next time use other delivery services. GrabFood customer service is great, and refunds you less than 30mins. However, highly expensive and grabfoodunlimited deals are actually limited.

My collegue uses ShopeeFood a lot and its super cheap compared to GrabFood if you compare the same store prices. In addition, if you are familiar with Shopee's coupon discount, there are tons of it in ShopeeFood. We usually buy bulk for lunch in office and got discount up to rm30! I don't have any experience with ShopeeFood CS so can't comment on that. || not the first time I saw complaints about foodpanda customer service, just avoid using them next time.

I avoided foodpanda since they outsource their agents, who have no idea what they are doing at all. Solely used grabfood, refund process takes 5-10 mins only after submitting claim. Their customer service also local people, with proper english. || I stopped ordering from Foodpanda. Always GrabFood.

Twice, I have ordered at a restaurant that is still available in GrabFood but they are actually closed permanently. I cancelled my order and got my money back. || Report to kpdnkk, don't waste time with those stupid foodpanda cs || Hey OP, I've previously faced issues with foodpanda before. Pretty much just file a complain to  kpdnhep and they will handle the rest for you. I was contacted by foodpanda CS team after about 3 weeks, issued me a refund + a voucher || Foodpanda is the worst for getting refunds. Even if you get a valid refund (like food damaged, I kena they deliver so bad drink spillage all over my food) they will nickel and dime you. Meanwhile Grab will just terus give you the refund as long as can provide the pics and stuff. So I always go grab now since a few months back.

Not to mention foodpanda some of the deals and offers won't apply to you or they will just hide from your account. Really waste of time and money. The deals and offers look really good la which is why it is appealing but really not worth it in the long run everytime got issues. || Did you initiate the cancellation or did the restaurant initiate the cancellation? || Pernah order makanan tapi tak sampai masa pkp dulu. Chat dengan CS, the first guy kata makanan dah sampai tak boleh refund etc., then left probably because he ended his shift or something idk, and another person replace the guy (can see the name of operator changed) lepastu explain balik, and this new operator start refunding my money, took about 7 working days iirc. 

Conclusion: tengok nasib || The restaurant itself can cancel the order but nah they just throw it back to you.","Foodpanda Refunds Hey all! i figured i’d come here for advice.

I ordered food through foodpanda this morning and the restaurant called me saying their items were out of stock. Then proceeded to cancel the order and they agreed. Foodpanda agent then called me saying that they will not refund me considering the restaurant has prepared my order. I proceeded to tell the agent that the restaurant themselves told me they were out of stock, how could have they prepared it? And then the agent told me to claim through the app and she will refund it for me. I have then tried to talk to live agents and two different agents told me i am not able to be refunded considering the restaurant has already prepared the food and it’s a waste. To confirm their statement, i called the restaurant if they have prepared it and they said they didnt prepare anything. I’m at a loss and pretty upset that this happened. Any advice would really be helpful and appreciated deeply.

Social media bring alot negativity. (Sesi meluahkan perasaan),"Many months ago i delete most my social media (FB,IG,X,TT, linkedin, and couples more) except Reddit and bookmark local newspaper website to less fomo, atleast for now.

I'm working on vfx studio, i used to follow up all things about my related industry for years but socmed being socmed, the algorithm, there's too much unnecessary drama, toxic comments, too many bad news, too many good news(pun sama boleh ganggu fokus), it build more my anxiety and i got panic attack couple times and major depression.

For example like tiktok ig, really changed our society skewed of misinformation, play false emotion, hatred all side/angles, mixing all that it's become harder to use for stuff.
Even i tried curated heavily. I used to share my artwork but now socmed more like a shitshow, socmed companies doesn't care the user as long people keep using it. 

I understand socmed can be good content and benefits, because it used to be good in early days, but the outcome is bad for people's minds in long term in my problem lah.
There's a things of see too many good things has the side effects as well.

Another reason why i delete is concern security and privacy about me and my family, people asking me like ""hey, u punya family ada buat_____ itu ini eh? Kenapa buat mcmtu je, nasihat je?"" It feel uncomfortable that i had to cover story others my family ""business"".
But if my kenalan share about me, yeah... That I can't do anything. 

The reason i post here because in this subreddit and bolehland slowly people share that and it's like asking flaming more drama in here as well, example like foodpanda and abg wira. Weird politics moment as well.

People might say to me, ""delete2 pun addicted main Reddit juga"". I addicted because i am already addicted to internet itself since 90s, so its irrelevant , what i meant is in general socmed are truly designed to be addictive of collectively toxic peoples. 

Ok im typing too much but i hope  doesn't affect future young generation... Even though i think too late but I'm still hopeful. 

Understand that i never mentioned to other people suruh delete socmed, but it can be moderation and be mindful.
It just not for me anymore.

Currently im mindful what to read and i spend more conversation with my family than before.

Anyways, Thanks for reading.

Extra note 1 : actually I am really very happy nowadays compared to many months ago. Not depressed anymore, above just want to do confession. Thanks for good response i got.","Something I heard from someone about ""getting bored is a lost art"" and I really agree.

I remember in my childhood when we didn't have internet, we get bored and read books, watch some TV, go cycling, and personally I learned how to use a camera which eventually became my hobby,

Now I don't mean that we should all go back and get bored and do nothing. But I think the possible mindset shift could be ""it's fine to do nothing"". And I mean nothing as in, not even scrolling social media.

There's too much information, drama and toxicity in social media and now I find it counter-productive (I used to use it to share my photography stuffs).

Anyway, I've been having a social media diet for about 2 months and it's working great for me. I'm actively seeking our to improve my hobbies and find the same hobby groups. || Great job on quitting social media. I have quit as well over a year ago and it's been amazingly peaceful. Better relationships with family and friends as well as you are not clouded with jealousy and just be real with people.

So many documentaries on the bad effects as well so it's not just in your head bro, it is damaging and I'm glad you're done with it too, enjoy it and never go back to it, after some time you will realise why did you even spend so much time and energy on it and caused your own self so much upset-ness for nothing.

You will need to do something else to fill in the time tho and also be patient while queuing or on public transport cos you will not be scrolling anymore. 

You will also enjoy better focus and actually creating more of your artwork without the pressure of having to keep showing you are doing something to others, it's all in your timeframe and goals and you will actually be so much more productive! || I only have Reddit & Whatsapps. Left Facebook & LinkedIn long time ago. Have more time to myself to real life things || My problem with social media in general is that you're force to know and care a lot of information at a time. That's not counting shit takes and useless dramas. That really exhaust your mind.

That's why I made a new twitter account, follows only my interests, shitposts and content creators that I only like. No celebs, no fan accounts, no politicians or influncers also not even my friends. || I agree, I think social media warps our perception of what’s real and common vs what only a small percentage of the population experience. 

Similarly, apps like Tiktok and Instagram make us believe so many people look like models and thus lower our self esteem a ton. 

I also hate how everything is an ad or marketing these days, I just wanna be able to enjoy life without being bombarded with products that are supposedly going to make my life better or something. No I’m not going to throw away all my money on some dumb course or beauty product, thanks.

I feel infinitely better after deleting all my social media, I keep reddit because it’s informative and not primarily a photo-sharing platform. Plus you can curate your feed based on the subreddits you follow, unlike other sites. 10/10 would recommend for better mental health. || I quit facebook, twitter, instagram. I keep reddit because it's more chill kinda and there is news published here as well. Any additional news my wife will tell me || To me, socmed is just like a virtual kopitiam. The pakciks of yore used to hangout in kopitiam in the mornings to catch up on latest news and give their hot takes to each other and go home for lunch after. 

Now, we're hanging out in the virtual kopitiam at every 15 min breaks in our lives, it's not only toxic, but it's overdose, even if the posts and comments we see are actually positive. 

I think limiting our socmed usage time to before work and before bedtime is the best. Just for catching up purposes and not let it dominate our real life. || Hang in there bro! I hope you find peace inshaAllah. 

Nothing wrong with having no social media accounts. Working in VFX with it's long hours and sometimes endless, repetitive tasks can also really affect your mood and whole outlook on life because of just how tired you get. The stress creeps up on you and wears you down, at least that's how it was for me a long time ago.

What worked for me was to find hobbies or activities that required no PC or any electronic gadgets as much as possible, just to break the cycle of constantly looking at screens all day long. This will make you focus more on the important stuff when you actually do go online and read, because you'll have less time for all the nonsense, which in turn should eventually make you feel less depressed and stressed out. || I uninstalled Instagram last week and already saw major improvements in my life. Picked up cross-stitching and cooking!

It just came to the point where I realised I don't need to know that A and B did X and Y. And I don't have to show my ""network"" that I did this and that. Things that I really wanted to share would be sent straight through WhatsApp, meaning that relationships with family and real friends really are gonna improve drastically.

Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect?,"Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me?","[https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims

That RM 1,800 is guaranteed, consistent income for a fixed working schedule. I fear that Grab might tempt OP to work longer during slower days, comprising his/her time to focus on studying.",8/9/2023,16,15.0,1694194133,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/16dgnqh/is_it_viable_to_do_grabcar_part_time_as_a_student/,"Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect? Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me? [https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive.

[Female employee was hit for no reason]


A very serious incident happened in our store! The
delivery riders from Foodpanda threw things at our staff!


Here's what happened: we had an order waiting for 30
minutes, but the Foodpanda rider assigned to it had not arrived yet. So we notified the system, and they
arranged for a new rider to deliver the order.
After 45 minutes, the original rider arrived with another
friend. He argued with our staff because he was
unhappy that he was replaced. He then threw the
beverages at our female employee, who was scared
and started crying.


I told them that this behavior was inappropriate and that
we should calm down and talk it out. After some
arguments, the rider again threw the menu at me and
challenged us to call the police. He claimed that his
house was just behind our store. We were stunned and
mad at their attitude and behavior!
We want to clarify that we are not authorized to replace
delivery riders. We were just worried about keeping our
customers waiting and then filing a complaint in the
system. As it does not show that our store has
completed preparing the order.


On the day of the incident, we reported it to the police.
Unfortunately, they said no one was injured, and nothing
was damaged in the store. Therefore, they could not
take any action and only filed a report. No police officer
has contacted us to follow up on the situation!
We feel bad about this. Can't we seek justice for our
female employees against this kind of thuggish
behavior?
We have always taught our employees to treat people
with courtesy, whether they are customers or delivery
riders. Our employees must express gratitude when
delivering food.


We also understand and appreciate the riders' efforts in
delivering our food rain or shine. We even offer all-day
discounts to all delivery riders to show our appreciation.
We also want to emphasize that we have encountered
kind and responsible delivery riders. Rude delivery
riders are just a minority.
Lastly, we hope the delivery rider who caused the
incident can be punished accordingly and apologize to
our female employee. They should also guarantee that
they will not repeat this offense against anyone else!


Although we have reported this to FoodPanda, one of
the delivery riders is still delivering food, and it is
possible that he is using someone else's identity to
continue doing so! We hope that all businesses can be
more vigilant! || Police can’t take action? What the fuck? Really || the bigger bullshit is that our police cannot take action because no one was injured....

so if i throw shit at a balai is ok? coz no one is injured and nothing was damaged right?

Need help for money management for fresh grad!,"Hello students and fresh grad. Just want to know what is your average daily spending and cost of living in shah alam, selangor? I just finished my internship and working as Junior IT consultant (contract for 2 months, gonna rest after finish and find other jobs in data scientist related field after raya) with Rm2k salary (yea i know quite low but the workload is not that much huhu), tolak epf and socso got around Rm 1.8k. My average spending for food per day is around Rm 18 per day. Kadang rasa cam banyak 😅, kadang rasa normal. Makanan always tapau je, kalau weekdays biasa spend kat breakfast Rm 3-5, dinner Rm8-10. Weekends Rm 15-20 for 2/3 meals (i use foodpanda). But kalau member ajak lepak, kadang boleh cecah Rm 20-30 but that's an outliers.

Komitmen lain:

-Petrol: Rm 5-6 per week, Rm 20-24 per month (rumah sewa 2.5km dgn tempat kerja)

-House rent: Rm 210 (utilities included)

-Phone prepaid: Rm 20

-Toiletries: Rm 100 (sabun, toothfloss, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, etc)

-Entertainment: Rm14 per month (tgk wayang kalau ada movie mantap)

-Laundry: Rm 4 per week, Rm 16 per month (dobiqueen) 

1) should i cut something? 
2) how much should i save per month? 
3) should i buy raw stuff/ingredients and cook at home? how much can i save if i do so😅.

p/s: im happy the way im living right now, no pressure, but feel like fancy and boros sometimes because of my food spending. and i really miss the time when living with my parent, my mum's cooking, it's good and it's FREEEE🥲.

Thank you in advance!","Might be worthwhile reposting this in r/malaysianpf || You spend a lot on food and toiletries, please consider cutting down || Rm18 for 2 meals a day, in kl is considered really cheap. So don’t beat yourself up about that. If anything, spend rm2-5 more to get some fruits into your system. 

If the rental house allows u to cook, and if it has some pots n pans, you can learn to cook some simple pasta. 

Pesto Penne is easiest. Boil the pasta for about 7-8 mins, drain then mix in 2 spoons of bottled pesto. You’re set. Pasta is about rm7 a box. Pesto sauce I think is rm20. Can get about 8 servings out of the pesto sauce bottle, with lots of pasta left in the box for next round. 

Other than that, don’t think u can cut out much else unless u become social outcast and just stay at home (not recommended). You’re on your first steps of adulthood, so current earnings aren’t exactly going to help you.

Rm100 for toiletries, seems a bit much haha. I don’t use cologne so maybe mine is cheaper. || You don't eat lunch? || Well nothing much to cut down from your monthly budget except food expense. You also have justified your spending on the toiletries. Im surprised you only spend RM 20 for your phone prepaid. 

From my own experience, cooking homecook meal can be really hassle especially if you cook Malay dishes (need alot of aromatic ingredients & spices).  Then after that you need to clean up the kitchen space. Not really worth it if you cook in small batches. During my early years of working & living away from my parent, i had done this to reduce my food expenses.

I do cook at home but it really 'basic', more of 'slicing & assemble' the food. The only more 'complex' things i do was cooking rice using a rice cooker & boiling eggs using electric multi cooker.

I will boil the eggs in large batches (4-6 pcs) at a times & keep it in the fridge. My diet was basically fruit, vegetables that can be eaten raw (cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes etc), boiled egg, bread (sandwich), rice & oat.

In the morning i usually eat oat with fruit or egg mayo sandwich as breakfast. Both was really easy to make. For oat meal i just need to add hot water &  diced fruit on top of it. Then for the sandwich, i mash the hard boiled egg & mix it with mayo. Slicing some vege & assemble both of it with bread as sandwich. 

During weekend i cook a rice & eat it with boiled egg & raw vege as Ulam with sambal tumbuk for lunch. Sometimes i will buy lauk (chicken, meat or fish) from the restaurant with kuah kosong. Then i cook rice at home & sliced the vege for Ulam. Oh i forget to mention, i usually buy 50sen of ice cube from local grocery store almost everyday & make large batch of sweet ice lime tea (teh O ais limau) that last me for a whole day. Maybe the sweet ice lime tea that keep me going because i usually eat a lite lunch or sometimes skip the lunch.

But the most saving came from free 'dinner'. I usually go to local masjid for maghrib & isyak prayer. People usually donated food especially for majlis tahlil & during malam jumaat (bacaan yasin). If there no donated food for the day, i will eat oat with diced fruit for quick dinner. Actually going to masjid also help you built relationship with local community. Those masjid congregation was really a decent people. They will sincerely help you if you got any trouble. Having a support group like that while staying far away from your parent & families was really a bless.

My diet might be boring but i manage to survive on that. Definitely not for everyone to follow because not everybody can eat almost the same basic food everyday. Hope the best for you as now the food price not as cheap as before. Even egg price was damn expensive now. || Learn to cook || Masak at home can be mahal or murah depending on what sort of food you cook. If you can eat the same thing a few days in a row then you can save quite a bit. Like i usually meal prep for 5 days terus but im the type tak kisah makan the same thing repeatedly. But if you like your variety then having to cook different lauk everyday for one person portion macam not so jimat. || Alright will do!

Hello students and fresh grad. Just want to know what is your average daily spending and cost of living in shah alam, selangor? I just finished my internship and working as Junior IT consultant (contract for 2 months, gonna rest after finish and find other jobs in data scientist related field after raya) with Rm2k salary (yea i know quite low but the workload is not that much huhu), tolak epf and socso got around Rm 1.8k. My average spending for food per day is around Rm 18 per day. Kadang rasa cam banyak 😅, kadang rasa normal. Makanan always tapau je, kalau weekdays biasa spend kat breakfast Rm 3-5, dinner Rm8-10. Weekends Rm 15-20 for 2/3 meals (i use foodpanda). But kalau member ajak lepak, kadang boleh cecah Rm 20-30 but that's an outliers.

Komitmen lain:

-Petrol: Rm 5-6 per week, Rm 20-24 per month (rumah sewa 2.5km dgn tempat kerja)

-House rent: Rm 210 (utilities included)

-Phone prepaid: Rm 20

-Toiletries: Rm 100 (sabun, toothfloss, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, etc)

-Entertainment: Rm14 per month (tgk wayang kalau ada movie mantap)

-Laundry: Rm 4 per week, Rm 16 per month (dobiqueen) 

1) should i cut something? 
2) how much should i save per month? 
3) should i buy raw stuff/ingredients and cook at home? how much can i save if i do so😅.

p/s: im happy the way im living right now, no pressure, but feel like fancy and boros sometimes because of my food spending. and i really miss the time when living with my parent, my mum's cooking, it's good and it's FREEEE🥲.

FoodPanda Malaysia has gotten to a new low. Where got free delivery?,,"With panda pro you get free delivery with any order RM25 and above.

Btw do note the free delivery ONLY applies to delivery fees, restaurant can still charge extra fees. || It's a bait tag, they state free delivery on alot of shops but u need Panda Pro to actually use it.

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Rider should be charged with langgar red light.  


A fund raiser should be done to help the driver. || Let me explain the riders mentality, they are the looking excuses to 'cari pasal' gang, to release their temper or establish their dominance. 

They are not trying to be hero, Don't ever try to sugarcoat their actions or mentality. 

They won't care which side is wrong or right, they are there for their own opportunities to execute their own lust and desire. Thus, that's a criminal activity, that fked up someone's life. || It scares me because this could happen again to anyone, especially if you are different skin colour. The moment these hooligan saw you're not one of them, they going to assume it's your fault, you are drunk, you are speeding etc.

Stay safe out there. || Myvi also did not run away, stopped to check on the rider

Rider should be charged with langgar red light.  


A fund raiser should be done to help the driver. || Let me explain the riders mentality, they are the looking excuses to 'cari pasal' gang, to release their temper or establish their dominance. 

They are not trying to be hero, Don't ever try to sugarcoat their actions or mentality. 

They won't care which side is wrong or right, they are there for their own opportunities to execute their own lust and desire. Thus, that's a criminal activity, that fked up someone's life. || It scares me because this could happen again to anyone, especially if you are different skin colour. The moment these hooligan saw you're not one of them, they going to assume it's your fault, you are drunk, you are speeding etc.

Stay safe out there. || Myvi also did not run away, stopped to check on the rider

Which E Wallet best?,"Grabpay used to be my go to e wallet. However with the reduction in point system, I'm wondering which of the e wallets (Grabpay, Boost, Touch n go, MAE) provides the best returns in terms of usage?

A Rant About The Panda of Food.,"I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

[Here's a screenshot for half the conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/279456085885321216/927448327304400966/InkedILLITERATE_LI.jpg). I feel right stupid having this much patience.

I literally got this same email more than 7 times now. It's all the same copy pasted garble cock but from differently named bots. This is beyond infuriating for something so stupidly simple.

Do people still use Panda Mart still...? Or do you guys just use FoodPanda for... well, food?

I know I risk this post not being worthy or relevant to Malaysia or r/Malaysia but holy shit did I need an outlet. I am sorry.","About a month ago I tried FoodPanda. Came 2.5hrs later. No way of cancelling cos the whole app couldn’t even load the Help Centre. The food arrived with a receipt saying to prep food by when, so I know it had sat for an hour and a half. In between, estimated time kept changing and a rider was assigned 1hr before it was delivered. Rider went around the world but not collect my food. When I ask the rider, he said he immediately went to the store to pickup when receiving the request.

I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution.

I literally got this same email more than 7 times now. It's all the same copy pasted garble cock but from differently named bots. This is beyond infuriating for something so stupidly simple.

Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions,"hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please! 

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions","1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat.

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions 1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

Tipping culture in Malaysia. Share your story/experience :D,"I know tipping is not a huge culture here in Malaysia. But have any of you tipped before? And what's your experience like?

For me, I rarely tip, but I do when I feel like that person deserves it. Imo, the service industry in Msia is tough, earning low wages and having to keep up with demanding and sometimes rude customers.

So whenever I see a waiter who gets out of their way to make my experience great, or even that Foodpanda rider who went through bad weather to deliver my food with a smile. I usually tip em.

It always make me happy to see their surprised face when getting tipped, I want them to know that they did an outstanding job and I hope that this small tip would make their day.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

MrBeast Burger in Malaysia,"I'm sure you'll be familiar with this business especially if you watch MrBeast's videos. This business has been introduced and had grown in both the USA and the UK.

Buying directly from digitally disadvantaged hawkers/food stalls around our area is one of the most straightforward ways we can support them during these challenging times. (Remember to keep the SOPs as you buy from them!!) We may be in lockdown right now, but the effectiveness of this map will be even greater once we're out of this period :)

This Google Maps layer compiles these stall's locations for us to easily locate them and drop by to support these stalls. (For now, only limited to KL and Selangor.)

**WHICH HAWKERS/STALLS?**

* Hawkers/stalls with owners, especially the elderly, who are less digitally savvy and cannot provide online delivery through apps like Foodpanda/GrabFood
* Hawkers/stalls that struggling to survive/are on the verge of closing down due to a lack of customers during this period

(You can start by looking at the ones in your own neighbourhood ;) )

"How much do delivery riders earn, on average?","Hey monyets, I'm an intern, rn. Least I can say is, the corporate market is looking a hell of a lot worse since COVID started.

Anyway, I'm opting to start out as a Foodpanda Rider after I graduate. The thing is tho, I'm curious of the statistics. I have enough savings to get a bike, and since food delivery is gonna be going around for a while, I'm planning of doing it too 

So.. how much on average, do grabfood, foodpanda, or any delivery riders earn if it was in a city? 

How many months can I expect to pay off the bike I bought? The ones under 150cc, etc...

Is it a worth it job to get some extra cash after graduation? To pass the time, even?

Just wanna get some insight from the delivery riders out there. Thanks!","hi bro, im a food panda rider. But just part time since im still doing my degree. So in a week i work for just about 3 days and usually around 5 hours per day. sometimes less than that. I can made around rm600 per month. So if u do full time, im sure u can reach 2K || As part-time ok else it will cost more to you in long term. The biggest drawback is you don't learn anything from the delivery gig job. || It's probably not worth it if you factor in depreciation, time and petrol. You are better off using the time to make yourself marketable to employers. || I see, bro. Thanks for the insight, 600/month as spare change is not bad, tbh. || Yeah true, its just the same thing day after day, I guess u can be pretty bored after a while. || Yea, breaking even is gonna be hard, if u factor those in. Just hope employers are still looking for people to work for them in this economy. || Lets not forget that when the economy reopens employers will be seeking to rehire those they let off previously (maybe not the same individuals, but similar situations), so you'll be competing with veterans regardless. But depending on industry I think its still pretty good odds to get a job so long as you dont set your asking salary too high, since employers will be dealing with tight budgets then. 

&#x200B;

Honestly tho, I dont really think its such a big thing to consider depreciation. If you're using that bike only for delivery, then sure its something to think about. But if that bike is also gonna be your transportation for other stuff, then you basically dont have to pay money for a car or public transport anymore. Petrol wise.... I dont think its an issue either, since motorbikes arent subject to traffic jams the way cars are, so long as you're being efficient with your fuel (refrain from unnecessary accelerating and braking). Time on the other hand... if you already have a job, then sure.. focus on that. If you're unemployed I'm pretty sure you dont spend 17 hours a day surfing jobstreet and looking for a job. Surely spending 3-5 flexible hours a day earning side income doing deliveries is possible. My neighbor is retired and he's doing Grab deliveries with a car for a few hours a day, and he tells me the income is enough to cover the car's loan and give him some pocket money to spend.

foodpanda rider hit and run,,"kinda hard to respect them now . i know they gotta deliver food on time but putting others and themselves in danger is just ridiculous.  hopefully the companies take action and most importantly the CUSTOMERS have to be understanding . ive read tweets where riders were harassed and even threatened just because they received their food late || Food Panda drivers are particularly hopeless. They run red lights and very often going against the opposite direction.

I had several encounters with them breaking to laws, knocking my car but never had the decency to stop and apologise.

I saw an elderly man fell forwards avoiding the food panda driver swerving between cars. 

Their disgusting behaviour is unacceptable and FP is not doing enough to stop these nonsense. I know they don’t control their drivers but with the recent fiasco with the drivers, they could have turn it around to make this better.

They police often turn a blind eye and his gives the drivers a free pass.

The drivers also don’t respond well to the housing guards request to register often shouting at the guards.

I don’t know if this is a malaysian rempit mentality or just a pissed reaction towards FP.

Many restaurants are sealing their food package to avoid the drivers from drinking or eating the food.

How to get unlimited voucher discount on Foodpanda,"**Late late update:**

This bug no longer works. Foodpanda team patched it on February.

If you still need to save on discounts, **just buy an Foodpanda account from shopee sellers.**

It costs around **RM 0.55 - RM 1.00** per account. When you got the account, just use **PANDABARU** promo to get discounts.

The promo code gives you a **40% off** on your order but with a **max cap of RM 10**.

Also! Remember to follow the instructions from the sellers. They usually wrote about it in the description section. 

Btw, you can see active promo codes and their details on the official Foodpanda website.

You must have came across numerous Foodpanda account listings on Shopee, Lazada and others.

Some sellers price their services high, but there're still some who sell at a low price.

**But why pay, when you can do it yourself?**

**Note: I contacted the Foodpanda technical team long time ago regarding this \[Invite Friends\] bug. But they straight ignored my message and emails. Perhaps they have earned enough money already by** **~~scamming~~** **refunds?**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Basically, this bug is like inviting yourself to the system. Getting both welcome and referral reward vouchers altogether.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**What kinds of vouchers will this net you?**

**You'll get two vouchers:**

* **First-order: RM 10 discount off ( Min. spend RM 20 excl. delivery and service fees )**
* **Second-order: RM 10 discount off ( same requirement as the first voucher )**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Steps on how to get infinite discount:**

1. **If you have registered a Foodpanda account previously with your phone number written. You must log in to the account and change the phone number.**
   1. Just change it to random phone number like 016-999-999
2. Create a new account on Foodpanda
3. After you have reached the page where it asks for your phone number. Just click  ❌ on the top-right of your screen.
4. Then the account will be successfully created without a phone number.
5. Now. Click \[ Invite Friends \] from the options panel.
6. Tap your referral link once to copy the link automatically.
7. Go to your phone's browser and paste the referral link.
8. **In this step, your browser should redirect you to the Foodpanda app automatically**
9. **Try other browsers if you have an issue with automatic redirection.**
10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**
* **The voucher expiry date is 1 month from the claim date.**

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

…………………………………………………………..

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

o Encik Hanafi, pegawai di Kedutaan Malaysia di NY

o Host saya, Ruz yang awesome and her father Uncle Suffian

o Bobby dan seluruh building management team

o Abang guard yang selalu tolong hantar barang sampai depan pintu

o Abang2 Grabfood dan FoodPanda

Tak lupa juga kepada wardmate saya S, N dan Kak L. you gais are osemmmm...keep on fighting k!!

Setingggi-tinggi penghargaan dan terima kasih juga kepada :

seluruh warga KEMENTERIAN KESIHATAN MALAYSIA dan Hospital Sungai Buloh diatas pengorbanan dan usaha tanpa jemu dalam memerangi wabak Covid-19, dan memberikan servis yang terbaik kepada kami rakyat Malaysia.

Dan juga kepada doktor2 yang tanpa jemu memberi nasihat percuma kepada rakyat Malaysia di sosial media. Itulah tempat saya merujuk dan mencari ilmu kesihatan terutama sekali pada waktu dunia diancam wabak ni. Terima kasih Dr Rusyainie Ramli, Dr Sakinah, Dr Imelda, Dr Erna Nadia, Dr Hana dan banyak lagi para doktor dan jururawat yang banyak berkongsi ilmu. Serta team Public Health Malaysia, PQ Community, The Dressar, TheDiagnosa dan banyak lagi page berkaitan kesihatan yang lain.

Terima kasih semua!!

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

How to differentiate police in malaysia?,"Hi guys, i just want to share a bit harsh experience i have gotten in my life in Malaysia.

I am an expat living here for about 7 years this year. 

Last week i was going down from my condo to lobby to take my order from foodpanda with my gf around 9pm.

Suddenly there is one random guy admit himself as police shout at me “only one person each house can go out during RMO”. At first i did not notice he is police, because he is not in his uniform and then i said “yeah i aware of the rules, and we are not going anywhere as we are about to take the food only”. He keep scolding me with high tone for not following the RMO rules. 

He started asking for my house number, my IC, etc. I did not bring my IC since i thought i just went to lobby and settle everything. He keep prolonging the session until people are watching at us and create crowd audience there.

I seek for help from the security of my condo, sadly they cowardly doing nothing as they seems afraid to take action toward this guy who admit himself as a police. His defence was “giving me advice”. Then i said “i took ur advice, thanks. Wht else u want?”

Since the condition was not conducive anymore and he kept yelling at me and strike chest-to-chest on me. I started to thinking that it might go to “money” solution thingy.

I started losing my patience, and i said to him “who is not following the safety procedure now? Where is ur face mask? U dont follow physical distance rule (for striking chest2chest) , u create crowd and u see nobody wearing face mask here, isnt it increasing the chance of people here getting infected. Where is ur letter of duty?”

Then only he lost words and said “u get lost” 

I just wondering am i doing the right way?
Any tips for me for how to differentiate real police and the fake one (like a money oriented one)?","Malaysian police must wear police uniform while on roadblocks or MCO duty. As a civilian, you have the right to ask for his/her police ID. You even have the right to take a photo of the police ID for future reference if you're not certain that the person you're talking to is a police or not. || Real police carry their ID card at all times, even when not in uniform. You have the right to ask them to show it. [Here's a great article about what to do if confronted by a plainclothes police.](https://asklegal.my/p/how-to-identify-malaysian-plainclothes-police) || From your story I don’t think that guy is a policeman. A real police won’t bother to ask your house unit number. My apartment area always has a roadblock even before MCO. No policeman that stopped me bother to ask my house unit number. 

Best case scenario; that guy just scares people by pretending he’s a police. Worst case scenario; he’s a scammer or potential robber. ID card still can be forged. 

God forbid any bad thing ever happen to you but I always pray for your safety. 

Next time when you go to the lobby to take food, bring your phone along and record anyone that stop you saying they are police. Be calm and clearly record his face and snap picture of his ID if he shows one. Asked him nicely to show his ID and tell him you maybe double check his ID at police station. Most importantly just be polite answering his questions. He may use your word against you if he’s a real deal. So better safe than sorry. 

A real policeman won’t easily get angry or bother to be recorded. They know they’re legit if police station run his face id in police record. To him, he don’t lose anything because he’s just doing his job. But if the guy is an imposter, he should run. 

If you feel the guy is an imposter, all you do once finished recording, go to police station, tell the officer that someone approached you telling you that he’s a policeman. Then the officer will asked you to write official police report so that the investigation can be proceed. Then later give them copy of the video you recorded and then let police do their job. 

I know it’s easy to get panic if being approach by enforcer. Just be calm and answer them calmly. Malaysian’s enforcer is always being trained to be nice to civilians no matter how shitty the civilian’s attitude are. Their rule is simple: if you showing attitude to them, then you must be doing something wrong. || If they claim to be a police officer but are not in uniform, you can ask them to show you their police card which they should always have on them || Wait, you are an ‘expat’ but you have IC? || Why is a policeman at a condo lobby? You're at Menara City One? || Maa PunDek.. apa Security Guard buat?. 
Definately imposter.. 

1) Contact yr apartment Management, email them ,let they know whats going on. The Security Guard are suppose to vetting n help you. 

2) Depending on the response of yr Building Management, if lukewarm.. just call the Police Station informing them. Or You can ask a local to do that for you. (I strongly believe you should, as police can only act if theres information ). 

3) yr action will definitely help deter, that crook. || Just cough on him next time. || If they claim they are police and they are not showing their badge or any identification.

Is better for you to just walk away, if he is some kind of thug you are just getting yourself into trouble.

If he is a police, and he is maybe very tired or sick of his duty then maybe you will get yourself into a bigger trouble.

He was not wrong anyway, is MCO now, and you are going out with a party of 2 rather than just one.

If you are alone, and you have a good reason to go out, and the police come in a group with proper identification, I would agree you to confront.

But rule is a rule, just obey it and once you violated the law, you will just get yourself into trouble during this ""critical"" time.

This is a plea to all Malaysians.," To all the companies out there, the big CEOs, COOs, CTOs, board members, and bosses. Please, prioritise your employee's health and safety. 

Please, please, love your call centre staff, and all your front liners. If it's at all possible for your employees to work from home, even at a reduced efficiency, PLEASE LET THEM. 

The country NEEDS as many people as possible to stay home and stay safe. Your employees are scared and compromised every day they have to leave their homes. What if they get sick, what if they get caught by the police, what if the area they're in doesn't have food, what if the building they're in isn't as clean as it should be, what if they get sick, go home, and spread it to their parents or children. 

The medical infrastructure needs people to stay home, stay safe. Don't risk the spread, don't overwhelm our medical facilities. The more people are sick at the same time, the more people aren't going to be able to get the treatment they need, and that means a higher rate of death.

I get it though, while you sit at home now, your big worry now is how the company is going to survive financially and be able to continue providing for all employees in the future. That's why I say, if it's possible for them to work from home even at a reduced rate, let them.

Please, this is also not the time to worry about what the stupid customers who care about no one but themselves will say, this is the time to prove yourself as a leader of a business, and place your employees health and safety at the top of your priority list. 

&#x200B;

To all of us working from home, in comfort and safety. Please, give the brands and businesses a break. Don't bash them online for slower service, or long waiting times. Please understand the position everyone is in right now. Please don't be that person yelling at a service agent because you had to wait 45 minutes on a call. Don't be the person complaining at your slow internet because you can't watch Netflix. Don't be the person scolding Grabfood or Foodpanda for not giving good enough deals and/or fast deliveries.

You arrived office,  open the door after fumbling for ages with the bunch of keys you are not familiar with , musky hot air surge greets your face once you open the office door. Yr 1st PuNDek mumbling, cos you remember Boss tells you to print out the Customs forms n Consignee documents frm office and make copies!. 

You then sit down on yr colleague chair, scrolling the email for the consignee attachment. You mumble out a 2nd PuNDek, cos only found partial , Called yr colleague,  'Oh, its in 2 separate email lah, you cari tengok!'

 Since you are fond of her, no pundek mumbling..only a big Sighhh!.Aiyaaaaa.  You manage to say' Weii, mampuih loo macam nie, next time You ' all combine everything, sent 1 email to me laaa' .. 'Hihihihi.. nobody said anything wooo!, you tell boss lah' . Confused, You ask ""So, that day what you all meeting?"" . ' 'Dunno , Hihihihi , you take care arrr.. byeee!' .. .weii PunDekkk laaa . you tried to scream into the phone.. 

You then print a couple of  copies, the dot matrix printer screaming sound, wakes you up frm yr daydream. Finally! siap semua. You staple all copies, lay them out on boss table n also yr other colleagues table. mumbling incoherently... 

You then, tutup office, shuts down all switches ( yr Boss voice in yr head ""Make sure arrr, tutup semua . Nanti bole meletop!Oooo) . You walked down the stairs, cos not wanting to risk breathing  the  lift air, God knows hw much the virus hs multiplied in there, just waiting for you.

You reached downstairs, relieved to see yr trusty motobike still parked where you left it 1/2 hour before, Suddenly you  start to panic!! reaching yr backpocket .looking for yr keys. Ahhhh.. got it.What a relieve.  One step forward, then you release the biggest  PUNDEKkkk cry till then..

[MalayMail] Foodpanda delivery rider dies in collision in N.Sembilan | Malaysia,,"This is a rather unfortunate news. 

Although this was bound to happen due to how the riders ride. Delivery incentives by food delivery companies should be amended to not reflect delivery time as the such a heavily weighted contribution to their income. 

If anything, it should be more of a delivery within time and you're good, deliver it earlier than time, you get a fixed bonus. Then you will need a cooldown for the timer of the last order to lapse in order to receive a new order for pick-up. This way riders should ride safe and don't have the incentive to speed that much.

I am hoping that Anthony Loke can do something about this, as he has a good track-record on implementing laws that keep people safe. In my opinion, this won't be just a lack of enforcement issue, because if the incentives of speeding is there, the riders would speed nonetheless, and the coverage area is too wide for enforcement. || Takziah dan Al Fatihah kepada keluarga Allahyarham. || Nowadays riders like to not obey traffic lights.

Food/courier riders are known to often ride dangerously and often breaks the law. They are often a danger to themselves and the general public. There may be a systemic cause for this behaviour if this is the norm rather than the exception.

Putting the death of this rider into the news hopefully   pulls this topic into the public discourse. If enough attention is given, eventually public servants are pressured to take action and do something about it.

This man exposed trash littered everywhere in a Malaysian forest. It included Foodpanda delivery bags.,," 

Andy  Hickson was just minding his own business, going for a trek in a   jungle just outside of Gombak. And look what he came across.

Hickson looks at the camera before panning to record the piles of trash littered across the jungle floor.

But do realise that everyone's food delivery cost will go up. I'm fine with it, but is everyone else? || Lol can. Wages go down to cover the costs.

"Grab's services contributed RM9.9 billion to Malaysia's economy in 2023, about 0.5% of the country's GDP",,"Such a depressing state of affairs.

It is a capital flight where the profit is an existing wealth outflow out of the country.

Unless we continuously generating new wealth to counter the outflow, all may be well.

I never used Grab or other similar services, but it seems these companies are changing gears to earn profit and reduced workers' compensation, at the same time the demand is reduced relative to the pandemic.

It also created a culture of delivery riders impervious to traffic law, and being a menace to other road users.

Everything have a cost. || Grab is a parasite where delivery guys are underpaid, restaurants have to overcharge, and Grab gets all the money in between. They don't provide actual value.

Heck I just show this picture to my friend (late 20s) and she thought it's a real picture. || If a restaurant doesn't bother putting actual effort into advertising their food, can you trust them to put actual effort into making their food? || This so sohai, taking ""the picture is only for illustration purposes"" to the next level. || This is literally false advertising that is clearly designed to misleading customers.

Taking food photos isn't that hard, even smartphone photos can get the job done. Anything that isn't fake AI crap will work better.

This kind of laziness is why we can't have nice things. If there is one type of photography that cannot be replaced with AI, its product photography. || Agree. Of course la AI gonna look good and shi but I wanna know how my food looks like before I order it. Not gonna expect it looks 100% like the photo but atleast it's real photo. || Thank you for sharing. I'll boycott this kind of business. Using AI picture of products = couldn't be bothered about their products. If they are not bothered about what they sell, why should I? || I ordered from this place (not using AI photos) that showed dumplings fried or rather grilled the proper ""pot-sticker"" way.. .. when the food arrived it looked like someone used their hands to squeeze the dumpling smaller than threw it into a deep fryer.. thing was like hard and dry.. 

I put it in the review and the seller say ""Dear, (OMG SHUT UP WITH THE DEAR) picture for showing only"" 

I mean sure, but you are selling Chinese cuisine, what fucking region makes dumplings like this. || You should visit KLIA, most of the ads there now use AI generated images. It's so bad. || Even my local foodcourt stalls at Cheras have those AI food pictures. What you see in the photos are very different with what are served on the table.  I once pointed out the dish and the picture at the stall.

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

You can take your chickens back to KFC.","GrabFood customer service is so bad I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order) I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost.

Wholesome GrabFood Moment (read caption),"Yesterday I ordered GrabFood and requested cutlery as I didn't have any being a guest in a hotel room.

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe...

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe... 

 Cutleries should be free, and prices on Grabfood are hiked up rate. || RM1.05 for cutlery wtf

Boycott /s

Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

 I was expecting one of the lessons learned to be ‘Never get business advice from r/malaysia’!

But joking aside, ay bro, may you come out from this stronger and wiser. You did good overall. || One of the best pieces of working I’ve read here in a long while.  And maybe on Reddit too. 

Many nuggets gleaned. Mucho gracias. || I wish you better outcome in your next venture, OP. || I've been in FnB business for a decade,built from zero. You must go all in in order to succeed, and about the family part, it goes for every business. Just don't mix business with family. || Thanks for sharing your experience OP, really appreciated your stories, I really need that because I'm about to open my business here in kuching selling beignets

guess I gotta give it All In.

Wish me luck! 🤞🏻 || Curious of this brand as some people touted this as local brand alternative to KFC. Finally decided to give it a try during the recent bazar Ramadan.


The chicken were bland. The sauces were bland. Like no salt and seasonings at all. And like OP said, they only sell chicken and sauces. With price not cheaper than KFC. The batter was ok, I guess 


Anyways, all the best for OP. I'll stick with KFC and McD for the time being || i have been a retail biz owner almost 2 decades...ppl ask me whats most important? they usually think...marketing...or sales...etc..  

The answer is... HR. as a boss, my most important job is to manage HR...keep staff happy, keep my managers happy, everything else is easy. || Sounds like you learned some important life lessons first hand. All the best for the remaining ventures and frayed family ties || It's always management when comes to business
If u can manage it right, it will be smooth

But humans are the most complicated things to manage, so it's always pain in the ass to deal with

Lastly, getting family/partner/friends involve it's a big no-no, which I very agree on

Unless you have brief the other about the business concept n the mindset + understanding of business operations, you could try.

But if after hearing all that n the person has disagreement or doesn't buy your concepts, forget it.

But well done man, u did what u could. Business it's not easy to run when you're the only person that manage everything including staff n finance, it's a huge dilemma n pain in the ass. || Are you based in KV? There are almost 10 or more MHC stalls in KV when I googled it. Would love to buy some fried chickens from you before you close your stall for good.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation.

Grab Account Suspended?,"My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

The rider also told me to not pick up the CS’ calls because I think he wanted to scam me and said that I didn’t pay. 

I have the same problems as you. Can’t contact anyone. There’s only a page to make an appeal. I was rejected once and was ignored for the second appeal. I just made my third one. I only got a message saying I have to settle an outstanding amount after the first appeal.

Now I know that I can’t trust these food delivery riders now. I’ll just use grabpay wallet instead of cash next time to pay. Freaking thieves and even had the audacity to get me suspended.

What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?,"Spent a year in Bangkok during the pandemic when they were handing out unlimited ""Covid extensions"" before travelling around elsewhere. I've been back in Malaysia recently and I noticed things have changed so much before I left. Mostly, what's with all the shortened opening hours?

Most 7-Elevens in my area (Mont Kiara, KL) and the surroundings are closed by midnight.   
FamilyMart shuts by 2 am.  
The only convenience store that opens 24 hours is KK Mart but it almost never has anything I want.

Also, GrabFood's severely limited past midnight, with little other than *mamaks* and Middle Eastern food (coming all the way from Bukit Bintang).

I'm mostly awake during US working hours, so the limited options available is really getting to me.

I've lived in KL since 2006 and I remember the city used to have much more life in the past-midnight hours.

Have things really changed a lot since 2021, or is it just me?","Yeah, people have begun to demand actual living wages and better working hours.

That, and the stronger restrictions on immigration that made it harder for foreign workers to enter. || Lack of workers due to a somewhat recovering economy and some issues with importing workers from Bangladesh

People are now opting for actual jobs, as the job market is slowly recovering while the supply of foreign workers was stopped for quite a while during COVID and afterwards due to syndicates/negotiations (notice how Mamak restaurants were understaffed a few months ago?) 

In other words, those sectors you see with short opening hours are understaffed and are not hiring enough people

The number of Grab drivers has decreased significantly due to smaller commissions and the economy recovering, so a lot of the previously unemployed who worked with Grab are now getting proper jobs || Many places that used to operate 24hours already cut down their operating hours post covid. 

People also more careful with their spending. || Other premises I'd probably just chalk it up to lack of demand.

But what I don't understand is Grab(Taxi) operating hour: aren't you suppose to haul a taxi instead of driving yourself when you're night drinking outside? 

What's the point of it if they stop operating pass 12 am? 

If it's the hassle of working pass 12 am, Uber already have a solution of allowing them charge high price to compensate for it. || for consumers? yes it’s good to have 24hrs shops for convenience. However, lots of European countries close much earlier than that. This is because workers are humans too, and they need a great work-life balance. I’m not saying we should be like them, but things are not the same as before, people are tired of taken advantage to work long hours. I think we are approaching a better path rather than having a standard for being too convenient all the time. || 24hr shift work not good for health.

I argue that shift work should be abolished except for essential services workers like healthcare - for those working shifts, more days off must be granted in lieu.

>What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?

Sorry but the way you phrase the question sounds like an entitlement to me. 

People deserve better working hours and conditions. || I asked the same question to the staff of the local FamilyMart (closes by 11pm) and 7-11 (closes at midnight). They both used to be 24-hour outlets but not anymore since the height of the pandemic. Even after PKP 3.0 i.e. Abah’s Last Stand, they never reverted to their original operating hours. When I asked, the staff replied that the owners of the respective outlets felt that after-midnight sales are not enough to justify opening at those hours, so the owners decided to close before/by midnight.

Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect?,"Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me?","[https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

I would rather work part time for something else if i have the know how or network/social skills, because the uncertainty and how tiring the part time job is

Typing this while at work, if grammar/language bad, is because i have to pause and do work, some big customer DR activity today, saturday also work cannot do grab car today… || I'm a Grab driver. I only drive at night, but my day job is very undemanding, hence I can drive long hours at night. The KPI I set myself is minimum 6 hours or RM 150 profit per night. I drive an Almera; full tank gives me about 450-500km on no-jam drives, but I simplify it by setting RM 30 per day for petrol. The target you set of 2000 per month is easily attainable IMHO. || As a university student, try to get a side hustle that complements what you’re majoring in e.g for a compsci student: building websites as a freelancer, or building an actual product that people would pay to use, or part time work in a software company.

As an aside, you can earn myr 5k or more monthly building software as a side hustle. Try browsing Upwork or any other freelancing or remote job boards.

There’s nothing wrong with working part time in a restaurant or driving grab per se, but there’s the opportunity cost of time that can be used to reinforce your learnings.

Your overarching goal should be to learn and to prepare yourself for your eventual career. The money will come later. || There's one post recently from 1 grab driver (KL area iirc) asking bout some opinion. If I'm not mistaken from his post,  your payrate is still the same regardless if it's rush hour or chill hour. If it's not in this subreddit, probably in r/bolehland. Good luck searching. || Grab take some % too from the fee. As general rule maybe say you get 50% from the fee. Considering petrol, maintenance etc. Maybe grab drivers can advise better. || I don't think you can. Not because of your age, but because Grab doesn't allow part-timers any longer. 

They changed their policies around 4 years ago. Before that, you could be a part time Grab driver as long as you're  21 and above.

Edit:
Sorry, you can be a Grab driver. I was misinformed. || Don't waste your time || work part time for event job || Agree with your advice. If I’m hiring, I’d rather pick someone with sales experience over driving a car around.

I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

I would rather work part time for something else if i have the know how or network/social skills, because the uncertainty and how tiring the part time job is

That RM 1,800 is guaranteed, consistent income for a fixed working schedule. I fear that Grab might tempt OP to work longer during slower days, comprising his/her time to focus on studying.","Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect? Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me? [https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers).

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Menu Price Difference on GrabFood,"So, recently I noticed that the menu  items of a particular restaurant are different by ~RM3-RM4 on GrabFood compared to their in-store price.

3rd time: accident - by the third time, confirm it is a collective thing between them to do this? 

4th time: lost wallet or something - like wth???

1. Breaching red traffic lights and when honked, there you go flashing that middle finger of yours or looking at me as if its perfectly normal.

2. Riding at least 80km/h over zebra crossings at schools with students around. School freakin students. Are you that of a degenerate? Schools reopened, yall dont own the road like you used to.

Many times in my own residential area they’ll shoot out at junctions without looking at the main road. I’m not even going fast, maybe 20-30 km, and they can still nearly hit me.

Half the time I see them looking at their phones. I mean c’mon la, I know you need to work, but do so safely. Check your phone at the side of the road and when you’re stationary.

The drivers drive like crazy. Whether i drive or walk, they are a menace. They park blocking cars even when theres a large pavement or motorcycle dedicated spots with space right next by.

They drive on large pavements, often almost hitting me many times when i walk.

ANd ofcourse when they beat red lights and get hit, it causes delays for everyone else, and they dont even have to pay for the damage they cause.

They will drive the wrong side of the road even on narrow one way roads, or even highways. A few times i've had to dodge an incoming biker on an exit going the wrong way even when there is an exit path leading the direction that the biker wants very easily.

They can run over people and still not have to pay anything (malaysian law favours motorcyclists). If you dont want mat rempits in the first place, both the law and police are needed, but police dont even care if bikers drive like mad, as they themselves dont even drive properly.

Does anyone still able to use GrabPay on modified devices?,"This is my previous post a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab\_wallet\_suspending\_soon\_for\_modified\_devices/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab_wallet_suspending_soon_for_modified_devices/)

I just wanted to ask: does anyone with Magisk still able to use or it's a no since 6/1/2021?

It's been a while since I last used Grab so I'm not sure about this, hope someone could shed some light on this. If I'm not mistaken, few months back it is still working because I attempted to place GrabFood order and seems to work just well.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

"How much do delivery riders earn, on average?","Hey monyets, I'm an intern, rn. Least I can say is, the corporate market is looking a hell of a lot worse since COVID started.

Anyway, I'm opting to start out as a Foodpanda Rider after I graduate. The thing is tho, I'm curious of the statistics. I have enough savings to get a bike, and since food delivery is gonna be going around for a while, I'm planning of doing it too 

So.. how much on average, do grabfood, foodpanda, or any delivery riders earn if it was in a city? 

How many months can I expect to pay off the bike I bought? The ones under 150cc, etc...

Is it a worth it job to get some extra cash after graduation? To pass the time, even?

Just wanna get some insight from the delivery riders out there. Thanks!","hi bro, im a food panda rider. But just part time since im still doing my degree. So in a week i work for just about 3 days and usually around 5 hours per day. sometimes less than that. I can made around rm600 per month. So if u do full time, im sure u can reach 2K || As part-time ok else it will cost more to you in long term. The biggest drawback is you don't learn anything from the delivery gig job. || It's probably not worth it if you factor in depreciation, time and petrol. You are better off using the time to make yourself marketable to employers. || I see, bro. Thanks for the insight, 600/month as spare change is not bad, tbh. || Yeah true, its just the same thing day after day, I guess u can be pretty bored after a while. || Yea, breaking even is gonna be hard, if u factor those in. Just hope employers are still looking for people to work for them in this economy. || Lets not forget that when the economy reopens employers will be seeking to rehire those they let off previously (maybe not the same individuals, but similar situations), so you'll be competing with veterans regardless. But depending on industry I think its still pretty good odds to get a job so long as you dont set your asking salary too high, since employers will be dealing with tight budgets then. 

&#x200B;

Honestly tho, I dont really think its such a big thing to consider depreciation. If you're using that bike only for delivery, then sure its something to think about. But if that bike is also gonna be your transportation for other stuff, then you basically dont have to pay money for a car or public transport anymore. Petrol wise.... I dont think its an issue either, since motorbikes arent subject to traffic jams the way cars are, so long as you're being efficient with your fuel (refrain from unnecessary accelerating and braking). Time on the other hand... if you already have a job, then sure.. focus on that. If you're unemployed I'm pretty sure you dont spend 17 hours a day surfing jobstreet and looking for a job. Surely spending 3-5 flexible hours a day earning side income doing deliveries is possible. My neighbor is retired and he's doing Grab deliveries with a car for a few hours a day, and he tells me the income is enough to cover the car's loan and give him some pocket money to spend.

Getting loved by Kedai Kopi Yee Fung after I congratulated him on GrabFood of his news.,,"Story: Getting news about Kedai Kopi Yee Fung's laksa getting ""Essence of Asia"" recognition, so decided to order from him. Added a congratulation in the special instructions to the boss and asked him if can add some freebies XD

Received a WhatsApp msg from the boss of Yee Fung. Boss replied to me saying ""Hi boss (everyone is boss in Malaysia), this is Kedai Kopi Yee Fung's boss. Thanks to your support, we have our achievement today!""

When I get the laksa, I thought ""Aiya no extra freebies..."" Then when I dig, actually a lot more prawns plus more other stuff hidden underneath!

Go and be nice to your food providers. Type something nice in the special instructions box instead of leaving it blank.

1. They will feel good about themselves and put more heart into making good food.
2. You could get freebies surprizes
3. They will make sure your food is prepared well. Nobody wants to disappoint a big fan.
4. You will feel good too! || Oh I know this kedai, heard from my veteran coworkers and they like it.

It's famous one, at jalan gaya, KK sabah.

What to Expect from a Malaysian Quarantine Centre in KL,"Hi all! I want to tell you all about my ongoing experience as a Person Under Surveilance (PUS) in Kuala Lumpur. Hopefully this will be useful information of you are travelling home soon. I am a Malaysian Student travelling back from the UK. I arrived in KLIA on 27 July. 

After touchdown in KLIA, we were all given COVID swab tests before being allowed to pass through immigration. After everyone from your flight has done the test and gone through immigration, you will be taken to a hotel to complete your quarantine. The whole process from touchdown to the hotel check in took 6 hours despite there only being around 30 people on my flight. There was a lot of queuing and waiting around, and you are expected to wear a mask and face shield at all times. We were given some refreshments while waiting for the others after immigration but I still suggest you make sure you have your own water and plenty of masks so you can keep yourself comfortable. ***Remember to bring your own pen to fill out any documents and bring a hard-copy of everything, like your flight itinerary, letter of undertaking, approval letter to return to Malaysia, etc.

Everyone from my flight was checked into the Holiday Inn Express in KLCC. The room was immaculately clean, ensuite, lots of water and toilet paper provided, but unfortunately the windows do not open so no fresh air. There is a desk in the room too so it is definitely quite comfortable for one person to stay here alone but I couldn't imagine being cooped up here with someone else. 

Food is delivered 3 times a day within a certain time frame but they are often late. My hotel does not accommodate to dietery requirements such as vegetarian or vegan, and everyone is expected to eat rice, curry and chicken. You can order special meals at an extra charge and these will be delivered to your room instead of the standard fare. As a Malaysian with no special dietery requirements however, I think the food so far has been delicious even though it is usually cold by the time it is delivered to me. 

The system for ordering meals and extra ameneties such as coffee, sugar, tea or water is very disorganised and conducted entirely through whatsapp. Ringing the reception does not guarantee you an immediate response and they will usually only deliver your requested items with your next mealtime. No outside food and drink is allowed to be delivered to the hotel and of course all PUSs are not allowed to leave their room, not even wander the corridor. ***the hotel is trying to accommodate vegetarians but from what I’ve heard through the WhatsApp group, it’s not the best but at least they are trying. 

There is an intercom system with speakers installed in every room. The speaker's are very loud and there is no escaping it, the hotel management will announce warnings and reminders to stay in our rooms and threaten us with repercussions. It gets very annoying, especially when they are announcing it at 8am in the morning in multiple languages. 

Here are the things I suggest you pack with you for comfort during your quarantine: 
1. Metal utensils to eat with (only plastic utensils are provided by the hotel)
2. Your own shampoo and conditioner (the hotel only provides all-in-one soap)
3. A data plan for your own internet connection (the hotel wifi is very slow and a lot of people had trouble connecting to it. I wouldn't depend on it)
4. Snacks and condiments (you can technically order dry snacks via GrabFood or smth but I wouldn't depend on the hotel staff to bring it up to you in good time. No condiments provided with your food.) 
5. Cup noodles (in case you get bored of the standard meals)
6. Protein powder (meals are very carb heavy. Bad for gains)


***Update; 29 July: The fire alarm went off today which caused concern among the guests. Hotel management told us to stay in our rooms while they investigated the cause of the alarm. Turns out someone was smoking in their room. I pity them as they cannot go outside to smoke and it must really be killing them to have to endure this for 2 weeks. 

***1 August: Given a wristband and safety kit consisting of masks, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. I’ll be given another swab test on the 10th day and can go home if I it is negative. 

***I will keep updating this post with more information as it comes. I still have 12 days left in my quarantine.*** 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AT THE HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS. THERE ARE OTHER QUARANTINE CENTRES IN KL WHICH MAY PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE AND AMENITIES.","I have a few questions:

1. If you packed food with you in your luggage (e.g instant noodles, snacks etc) from your departing country, would they confiscate it? Coz since you say you need to pay extra for food and the ordering system is disorganised, maybe bringing some extra food over would help a little.

We are really disappointed and upset with the partnership with [**GrabFood**](https://www.facebook.com/GrabFoodMY/?__cft__[0]=AZX_4fh1IxKeGTQrsOCKR1k_MldU08svr_dQGnF9WaDQb8An2YI7dPrNKn5ecSzgbh4715QEpuH6CyScPfG9l58aQZMYW5JDBd5MyPuNeRUcTcU6hnKRajLCYlmopNtRA3yqtYpxBe4y-ySR7qOwgQKKyovWMLK65_m6NNfP4A4P-g&__tn__=kK-R). 

We have been on-boarded to GrabFood for more than a year now, and we have been a cooperating partner.   
Not until recently that we found out GrabFood has been very non-transparent in their assignation for restaurants availability in terms of radius. 

We have been receiving a lot of complaints from our customers about GrabFood not showing the availability to deliver within reasonable distance, and we thought this is due to GrabFood system that is set to be within a specific distance in each area. However what triggered the following case was on 26 May 2020, when we were alerted by our staff that GrabFood was unavailable for that day (imagine the sales that we lost, especially during this COVID period whereby businesses are struggling). Our sales from GrabFood on that day is ZERO. Upon checking, we realized other restaurants in same area is available but not us.

Hence we reached out to GrabFood merchant support via live chat and given the response that they off our restaurant availability from the back-end due to differences in commission rate by different restaurants, which means the restaurants which signed higher commission rate with them will get the priority and 'be available in more places'. And they switched on our availability back after our call.

We were very upset and escalated to the manager. He then gave us another explanation that GrabFood will allow restaurants with larger 'sales bucket' to appear in more places. If that's the case, it's discrimination against small businesses, or any businesses that have menu selling items with lower price.  
We gave feedback to them that this is not acceptable. And the manager promised to get back to us again after discussing with the team. It's been a week and we hear nothing from them.

Yet it happened again today..! We realized they 'turned off' our restaurant again after checking from the app. Hence we wrote a complaint again, and same cycle happened... (same canned response, and they switched back on)

We are deeply disappointed with such partnership relationship. Does this mean that we have to always check if our restaurant has been hidden from the platform? These occurrences have broken the trust, we don't know when their system will discriminate against us again and only switch back on after we found out and reach out to them each time. This is totally unfair to small and medium businesses. || Interesting, maybe this is why sometimes I see some restaurants in the same area being ""Unavailable for delivery"" despite being well within the riding distance, while others in the vicinity operate just fine. || Precisely why I don’t use these food delivery if I got the option. Their outreach into various industries for e-hailing, e-wallet and food delivery and the subsequent monopoly of the industry is extremely unsettling. || Time to switch to foodpanda? || 'Support your local heroes... who are willing to pay us more' || Capitalism at its finest... pretty shit of grabfood || Grab and Foodpanda charges around 30% commission, which has to be borne solely by the restaurants because they are prohibited from marking up their prices. If you sell your burger for RM10 on your menu, you can't change the price to RM13 on foodpanda to cover the commission. In an industry where profit margin is already thin, being on these platforms are not as great as it's hyped up to be. They're not there to help your business, they're there to help themselves. Fp and grab can suck it. 

If you want to support local businesses (as you should!), order takeaways or ask if they themselves can deliver. We did this during Ramadhan and we didn't even charge any delivery fee, and many local restaurants do the same. Support them directly! || [deleted] || Yeah. Was kind of expecting some shit like this to start happening already. For the most part, this is something that I expected “platforms” in the “sharing economy” to pull, sooner or later. It was one of the reason why I was so reluctant to get on Grab and their ilk, and only did it recently when I noticed the value of not having to rely on having cash to pay, and the fact that delivery was basically how we all stayed alive during the MCO.

So I do use these apps, but otherwise I try to reduce usage as much as I can. But yeah. Good to see that people are starting to realize what kind of shitty position you'll be put in when you start trusting these platforms. They want to maneuver you into a position where they become the sole buyer or seller of these services, and *then* the real hurting starts.

Incidentally: if you think that stopping the use of this platform and going to `$COMPETITOR` is going to make things better? It won't, if the competitor is another profit-making corporation. You're still going to get fucked over, it's just a matter of when.

It might be useful to see whether stuff like [platform cooperatives](https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad), where the platform is run and operated by the people who're doing the work, rather than some other entity skimming off the profits, might be something that Malaysians can come together with and bring up.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

…………………………………………………………..

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

o Encik Hanafi, pegawai di Kedutaan Malaysia di NY

o Host saya, Ruz yang awesome and her father Uncle Suffian

o Bobby dan seluruh building management team

o Abang guard yang selalu tolong hantar barang sampai depan pintu

o Abang2 Grabfood dan FoodPanda

Tak lupa juga kepada wardmate saya S, N dan Kak L. you gais are osemmmm...keep on fighting k!!

Setingggi-tinggi penghargaan dan terima kasih juga kepada :

seluruh warga KEMENTERIAN KESIHATAN MALAYSIA dan Hospital Sungai Buloh diatas pengorbanan dan usaha tanpa jemu dalam memerangi wabak Covid-19, dan memberikan servis yang terbaik kepada kami rakyat Malaysia.

Dan juga kepada doktor2 yang tanpa jemu memberi nasihat percuma kepada rakyat Malaysia di sosial media. Itulah tempat saya merujuk dan mencari ilmu kesihatan terutama sekali pada waktu dunia diancam wabak ni. Terima kasih Dr Rusyainie Ramli, Dr Sakinah, Dr Imelda, Dr Erna Nadia, Dr Hana dan banyak lagi para doktor dan jururawat yang banyak berkongsi ilmu. Serta team Public Health Malaysia, PQ Community, The Dressar, TheDiagnosa dan banyak lagi page berkaitan kesihatan yang lain.

Terima kasih semua!!

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

This is a plea to all Malaysians.," To all the companies out there, the big CEOs, COOs, CTOs, board members, and bosses. Please, prioritise your employee's health and safety. 

Please, please, love your call centre staff, and all your front liners. If it's at all possible for your employees to work from home, even at a reduced efficiency, PLEASE LET THEM. 

The country NEEDS as many people as possible to stay home and stay safe. Your employees are scared and compromised every day they have to leave their homes. What if they get sick, what if they get caught by the police, what if the area they're in doesn't have food, what if the building they're in isn't as clean as it should be, what if they get sick, go home, and spread it to their parents or children. 

The medical infrastructure needs people to stay home, stay safe. Don't risk the spread, don't overwhelm our medical facilities. The more people are sick at the same time, the more people aren't going to be able to get the treatment they need, and that means a higher rate of death.

I get it though, while you sit at home now, your big worry now is how the company is going to survive financially and be able to continue providing for all employees in the future. That's why I say, if it's possible for them to work from home even at a reduced rate, let them.

Please, this is also not the time to worry about what the stupid customers who care about no one but themselves will say, this is the time to prove yourself as a leader of a business, and place your employees health and safety at the top of your priority list. 

&#x200B;

To all of us working from home, in comfort and safety. Please, give the brands and businesses a break. Don't bash them online for slower service, or long waiting times. Please understand the position everyone is in right now. Please don't be that person yelling at a service agent because you had to wait 45 minutes on a call. Don't be the person complaining at your slow internet because you can't watch Netflix. Don't be the person scolding Grabfood or Foodpanda for not giving good enough deals and/or fast deliveries.

You arrived office,  open the door after fumbling for ages with the bunch of keys you are not familiar with , musky hot air surge greets your face once you open the office door. Yr 1st PuNDek mumbling, cos you remember Boss tells you to print out the Customs forms n Consignee documents frm office and make copies!. 

You then sit down on yr colleague chair, scrolling the email for the consignee attachment. You mumble out a 2nd PuNDek, cos only found partial , Called yr colleague,  'Oh, its in 2 separate email lah, you cari tengok!'

 Since you are fond of her, no pundek mumbling..only a big Sighhh!.Aiyaaaaa.  You manage to say' Weii, mampuih loo macam nie, next time You ' all combine everything, sent 1 email to me laaa' .. 'Hihihihi.. nobody said anything wooo!, you tell boss lah' . Confused, You ask ""So, that day what you all meeting?"" . ' 'Dunno , Hihihihi , you take care arrr.. byeee!' .. .weii PunDekkk laaa . you tried to scream into the phone.. 

You then print a couple of  copies, the dot matrix printer screaming sound, wakes you up frm yr daydream. Finally! siap semua. You staple all copies, lay them out on boss table n also yr other colleagues table. mumbling incoherently... 

You then, tutup office, shuts down all switches ( yr Boss voice in yr head ""Make sure arrr, tutup semua . Nanti bole meletop!Oooo) . You walked down the stairs, cos not wanting to risk breathing  the  lift air, God knows hw much the virus hs multiplied in there, just waiting for you.

You reached downstairs, relieved to see yr trusty motobike still parked where you left it 1/2 hour before, Suddenly you  start to panic!! reaching yr backpocket .looking for yr keys. Ahhhh.. got it.What a relieve.  One step forward, then you release the biggest  PUNDEKkkk cry till then..

E-Tunai Rakyat: A primer,"You may have read the announcement that the government has [selected Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets are selected for the e-Tunai Rakyat initiative.](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tng-boost-grab-selected-etunai-rakyat-initiative)

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities.",""" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong. ""

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)
I don't use grabpay because there's no incentive for me to do so. || Thanks for sharing this post OP ! || i earn more than 100k a year. would the ewallet verify with lhdn if i sign up for it in the app? || The only reason I use TnG is for RFID/Pay direct at the toll i go through every day for work. There aren’t many incentives for now but the reload process is almost instant. Have yet to try Boost (didn’t like that I can’t transfer money out of the account - not sure if that’s changed recently) and grabpay doesn’t seem to be accepted everywhere yet. Nice to see we are moving towards a cashless society :) || I use touch n go ewallet on a daily basis because i hardly carry cash anywhere I go. I dont like the idea of withdrawing money at Atm and the most i carry in my wallet is rm5.

My spending habit changed tremendously. I only eat out at a place that accept ewallet/card payment. I only make withdrawals if i decide to go somewhere that will require cash. || Boost reverted policies (changing cashback to coins) really making me wana uninstal the app, but then i got rm10 out of the blue, i mean i had to postpone my thought for now. || Touch and Go presented our company with an additional problem, used to be we blindly allow our sales and service team to claim TNG receipt, now we have them to itemize their spending and restrict it to only toll and parking if they want to use the app (one dude claimed over 1k via TNG, we found out he use the e wallet to makan) || TBH they should just unify TnG card and TnG eWallet.

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities. "" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card.

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)

PSA: Price difference between FoodPanda and GrabFood,,"This screencap is from today 30/05/2019.

Grabfood may have very attractive subscription plans and promos, but ultimately their price hike is too much. If you have no promo codes, consider comparing prices as Grabfood will most likely be higher (approx 30%). This is consistent across more than three vendors I've personally ordered from so do your research as well. Sometimes even with promo codes, Foodpanda comes out to be cheaper. As Grabfood also commonly have a minimum, consider Foodpanda if you often do take out for one. Don't be blindly attracted by promos, as it's not always cheaper.

If you have a shopback account, Foodpanda is eligible for cash back as well.

If you are used to Grabfood, currently they have a voucher code that is rather good (EasyEats), thanks u/KuzaSasuke for the tip! But once this promo is gone, to Food Panda I will go.

TL;DR: **If you have no vouchers, avoid Grabfood at all cost.** || thats why I prefer standard fast food delivery. || GrabFood's item price is higher than Foodpanda's total. I have never used GrabFood, but from this it looks like I never will. || Would the difference be because of the Brown Sugar Warm Pearls?

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)


","Alright || My experience is Grabfood and foodpanda is always always feeling bad for the food delivery guy, especially when it rains.  || It's a stapled-on business line, coz ""synergies"". What do you expect?

I always preferred startups that do one thing and one thing well. Happy with dahmakan if not for their incessant marketing spam. || TLDR,  


Judging by the organization and length of your post, i rate it a 11/10 pissed.   


Please do one for MyCar || Get your ass up your chair and go cook something or walk around your neighborhood and buy them or fast. Much healthier in a way || ""Even compared to foodpanda""?

It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

week sometimes daily spending fair amount money service quite shameful grab deteriorated quality service ever since uber decided forgo services buy grab shares list reasons grab utter shit even compared foodpanda appsystem error times ive ordered put screen process tracking page waiting whole order process updated nothing updated upon refreshing app get notified order could placedrestaurant available need refresh app like tracking page sometimes already heading restaurant suddenly cuts orders timer update without input ive also orders stuck order received long time suddenly food arrives multiple orders restaurant sometimes ive misordered restaurant resulted ordering twice said restaurant dont know grab cant offer restaurant group order one within certain timeframe instead making orders customer pay delivery charges paying delivery charges issue makes worse fact orders delivery people seems like waste time customers sometimes one drivers need stop someones house drop order take additional mins waste customers time also uses additional driver driver could taking delivery different area instead lack customer support cant remember grab used able inapp chat customer support like food pandauber eats remember button call straight grab customer support try sort orders cancel nowadays function way contact customer support app alone try use app link faq crap basically tell contact driver food order status think customers drivers responsibility call restaurants find whats happening regarding order go grabfood facebook find number call customer support even direct website couldnt find anything relating contact info dont know grab trying limit costs making hard customers contact support thus less refunds orders reducing customer support people general customer support service industry super important keeping customers notified happy super fail grab rating system find literally use rating drivers restaurants literally check restaurant listings restaurants listed ratings people small number people rating restaurant seems like every time rate order doesnt seem update system thought type info would useful customers since filter restaurants based rating seems grab doesnt really care food type classification one easiest things right dont understand difficult classify food properly whats use search food type function food typing wrong classified filter food pricing filter food pricing also correct example ie choose cheap pricing get sticky wicket pub medium pricing food threshold least define ranges pricing phantom restaurants sometimes theres restaurants appear list either open dont food inside list restaurant unable restaurants active sort food listed cluttering list loading restaurant list dont know since couple weeks back every time try refreshload restaurant list time load slow sometimes trying load lag app seems issue happens iphones since friends use android dont seem face limit previous order history app seems order limit previous order history reason people need claim meal expenses pay back friend previous order verify statements even check food ordered particular restaurant past orders theyre shit luck contacting facebook ask could email directly months order history exact reply orders stored system long period time history see app access reply email please advised currently order history visible last orders however take concern positively highlight higher management future improvement great job grab limit orders tldr things grab need improve rating system work rating system menu item like ubereats need able invite people share payment meals able favourite restaurant meal food maybe group together certain restaurants near group ordering maybe one order basket needed pay slightly extra delivery charge additional standard delivery charge per shopone driver needed classify food properly food type pricing alright experience grabfood foodpanda always always feeling bad food delivery guy especially

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof. I was already like ""how do I show proof of something I don't have?"". So then I called the customer service line (had to wait 10 mins Btw) and ask for details. The person explains that I needed to take a picture before eating and show all the things I get, which I guess make sense to always check what you received. Still, it's so frustrating to get punished for this. I'm one burger short, hungy, no refund, and angy!

3rd time: accident - by the third time, confirm it is a collective thing between them to do this? 

4th time: lost wallet or something - like wth???

1st time: no money for milk powder for baby, so i gave him some cash out for sympathy

2nd time: father in hospital due to cancer - i didn't give any, cos this one sounds too random and scammy

3rd time: accident - by the third time, confirm it is a collective thing between them to do this? 

4th time: lost wallet or something - like wth??? 

(these are all different delivery guys)

Has anyone experience this? I no longer feel safe ordering when all these delivery fellas keep coming up with scammy excuses to get money from you. Maybe should give them one star and complain to Grab. But yeah I’d feel uncomfortable if they keep asking all that.

During MCO they were treated as heroes. I am not sure why. They not doing it for free.

Taking food photos isn't that hard, even smartphone photos can get the job done. Anything that isn't fake AI crap will work better.

This kind of laziness is why we can't have nice things. If there is one type of photography that cannot be replaced with AI, its product photography. || Agree. Of course la AI gonna look good and shi but I wanna know how my food looks like before I order it. Not gonna expect it looks 100% like the photo but atleast it's real photo. || Thank you for sharing.

I put it in the review and the seller say ""Dear, (OMG SHUT UP WITH THE DEAR) picture for showing only"" 

I mean sure, but you are selling Chinese cuisine, what fucking region makes dumplings like this. || You should visit KLIA, most of the ads there now use AI generated images. It's so bad. || Even my local foodcourt stalls at Cheras have those AI food pictures. What you see in the photos are very different with what are served on the table.

I order a lot of Grab food a month (circa RM700-800) as I get some sort of allowance from company (due to remote work). 

When it comes to Grab ride, sometimes I can see that it is a few drivers which tends to spoil the whole bunch. They started behaving exactly like how taxi drivers were hated upon in the past. They basically became numb to their customers. From driving like hooligans and maniacs to simply blocking traffic and stopping indiscriminately just to drop off a passenger. || I think ppl talked about how Grab started the way they did because of their massive funding, right at the beginning.

Get ppl hooked in their services, by sustaining massive losses.

Now they're just trying to break even. Don't think they're profitable even?

The business model was never a viable one. || They had to start making money 1 day ... can't be making losses forever. || For food I completely agree it has been nothing but downhill. I don't use grab car so can't comment... for airport runs, use the train it comfortable and fast. Around town using mrt. || I *just* started to drive for Grab. I don't think I can turn-off auto-accept, although I don't cancel on anyone (when I get tired, I just go offline and finish my current job).

> Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded

I mean... that's fair, isn't it? 

> Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order) I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas. 

","I think it's mainly got to do with the law where if a motorcycle gets into an accident with a car, regardless of who's actually at fault, the car driver has to lay up || Ah yes, contribute to self bashing. Then again i did choose to ride i suppose.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

And then channel these redundant people to work on something else. || Unfortunately, because we practice a racialist political system, every problem is seen with racial lenses.

So even if we know how to fix the problems with law breaking motorcyclists, there is very little political will to do it.

Most law breaking motorcyclists are identified as coming from a particular race. This means that politicians who are self-proclaimed champions of this race will defend them till the cows come home.

Wholesome GrabFood Moment (read caption),"Yesterday I ordered GrabFood and requested cutlery as I didn't have any being a guest in a hotel room.

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe...

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

The chicken were bland. The sauces were bland. Like no salt and seasonings at all. And like OP said, they only sell chicken and sauces. With price not cheaper than KFC. The batter was ok, I guess

1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Wishing you all the best in your next endeavor.","Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story. Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.

Grab Account Suspended?,"My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

Funny thing is, they told her she got outstanding payment but there isn't any guidance on how to pay it, but also her account is suspended so she can't even login to Grab app.

So what's the quickest way to contact Grab support? And how did my mum even got outstanding payment if she only use cash payment on delivery?

The rider also told me to not pick up the CS’ calls because I think he wanted to scam me and said that I didn’t pay. 

I have the same problems as you. Can’t contact anyone. There’s only a page to make an appeal. I was rejected once and was ignored for the second appeal. I just made my third one. I only got a message saying I have to settle an outstanding amount after the first appeal.

Now I know that I can’t trust these food delivery riders now. I’ll just use grabpay wallet instead of cash next time to pay. Freaking thieves and even had the audacity to get me suspended.

What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?,"Spent a year in Bangkok during the pandemic when they were handing out unlimited ""Covid extensions"" before travelling around elsewhere. I've been back in Malaysia recently and I noticed things have changed so much before I left. Mostly, what's with all the shortened opening hours?

Most 7-Elevens in my area (Mont Kiara, KL) and the surroundings are closed by midnight.   
FamilyMart shuts by 2 am.  
The only convenience store that opens 24 hours is KK Mart but it almost never has anything I want.

Also, GrabFood's severely limited past midnight, with little other than *mamaks* and Middle Eastern food (coming all the way from Bukit Bintang).

I'm mostly awake during US working hours, so the limited options available is really getting to me.

I've lived in KL since 2006 and I remember the city used to have much more life in the past-midnight hours.

Have things really changed a lot since 2021, or is it just me?","Yeah, people have begun to demand actual living wages and better working hours.

That, and the stronger restrictions on immigration that made it harder for foreign workers to enter. || Lack of workers due to a somewhat recovering economy and some issues with importing workers from Bangladesh

People are now opting for actual jobs, as the job market is slowly recovering while the supply of foreign workers was stopped for quite a while during COVID and afterwards due to syndicates/negotiations (notice how Mamak restaurants were understaffed a few months ago?) 

In other words, those sectors you see with short opening hours are understaffed and are not hiring enough people

The number of Grab drivers has decreased significantly due to smaller commissions and the economy recovering, so a lot of the previously unemployed who worked with Grab are now getting proper jobs || Many places that used to operate 24hours already cut down their operating hours post covid. 

People also more careful with their spending. || Other premises I'd probably just chalk it up to lack of demand.

But what I don't understand is Grab(Taxi) operating hour: aren't you suppose to haul a taxi instead of driving yourself when you're night drinking outside? 

What's the point of it if they stop operating pass 12 am? 

If it's the hassle of working pass 12 am, Uber already have a solution of allowing them charge high price to compensate for it. || for consumers? yes it’s good to have 24hrs shops for convenience. However, lots of European countries close much earlier than that. This is because workers are humans too, and they need a great work-life balance. I’m not saying we should be like them, but things are not the same as before, people are tired of taken advantage to work long hours. I think we are approaching a better path rather than having a standard for being too convenient all the time. || 24hr shift work not good for health.

I argue that shift work should be abolished except for essential services workers like healthcare - for those working shifts, more days off must be granted in lieu.

>What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?

Sorry but the way you phrase the question sounds like an entitlement to me. 

People deserve better working hours and conditions. || I asked the same question to the staff of the local FamilyMart (closes by 11pm) and 7-11 (closes at midnight). They both used to be 24-hour outlets but not anymore since the height of the pandemic. Even after PKP 3.0 i.e. Abah’s Last Stand, they never reverted to their original operating hours. When I asked, the staff replied that the owners of the respective outlets felt that after-midnight sales are not enough to justify opening at those hours, so the owners decided to close before/by midnight. The local KK continues to be a 24-hour outlet even to this day, but the owner makes do by switching off the air conditioning in the store, and have only 2 staffers in the store past midnight. || Less purchasing power due to not good economy thus shop limiting their hours plus convenience store like 7e prone to get rob also due to people get lay off they turn to being criminal. || You have to understand that it's a commercial decision as AFAIK our government doesn't require businesses to pay workers more if their shifts are outside traditional working hours, so long as the working hours don't exceed the maximum allowed. .
(different from some countries like Australia where govt impose penalty/restriction on some businesses opening late)

So in malaysia if they close early is likely because business operations realised they won't make a good profit extending their hours, maybe cause employees want more pay outside traditional working hours, or infrequent customers to justify the expense. || Who in MK is going to work past midnight? the staff don't stay there. 

I mean the people in MK who worked in the 7E and McDs and whatever, were bored young people with rich parents. It was really something to do to pass the time.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on.

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more.

I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive. But while waiting for the food, I can do other things like watch tv. 😂",food delivery regulars grab food panda etc actually cheaper expensive disclaimer im new food delivery yes im super late scene trying understand hear people heavy users saying cheaper order decided try mostly using foodpanda see jacked prices everywhere like mcd example need add delivery fee compared buyatretail expensive see vouchers reduce price meet threshold maybe subscribe panda pro reduce delivery fees right even find prices arent much better compared dinein sure save time parking convenience pure cost meal see much difference generally expensive esp run vouchers missing trick secret method get cheaper price delivery heavy users get reward points ps notice dominos seem offer good pricing compared actual store price like dont hike much else actually used cheaper years ago crazy promo operating loss build customer base nowadays expensive dont subscribe even opt subscription actually smart purchase ensure ends cheaper eg breaking rm order two apply offcapped rm twice youre mainly paying premium convenience food coming rather going food taking account things like fuel price parking times definitely expensive whatever options eating food place say cheaper apply necessary vouchers order group theres also hidden payment conscience order caused rider road whatever weather distance many red lights passes eat speaking frequent grab food sometimes food panda user paying premium exchange convenience whether convenience worth hikedup price entirely decision add order frequently even order multiple items per order often order meals parents order costing rm average vouchers also conditional eg minimum order amount rm limited selfpickup also use accumulated grab points offset cost sometimes thats onceinafewmonths occurrence nothing shout really grab points almost worthless barely earn points days theyve revised times earning mechanics ordering via grabfoodpanda cases expensive need actively compare prices inshop grabfp know diff may instances cheaper vouchers hot deals etc common anymore days rather go tapau unless need convenience missing trick secret method get cheaper price delivery heavy users get reward points chaotic differs shops go touch grass figure ones cheaper roughly apply rule restaurant well without delivery orders wont bother reduce deliver menu price attract customers dont think last forever though grab example running loss decide stop trying attract customers delivery price always expensive think general rule restaurant prices delivery apps higher instore dont know places mostly order regular shops also frequent person yes dont try many different things im boring usually rm including delivery higher either app grab fp go buy use one grab unlimited vouchers order still rm expensive grab compared go youre heavy grabpay user means actually reloading ewallet paying accumulate grab points use offset cost food havent done calculation dont think points cash ratio great cheaper companies fighting competition gain marketshare lots funds offer enticing promo codes campaign ends things arent cheap theres always markup food price top high delivery fee grab unlimited member worth order least ppl discounts selected food vendors worth convenience long term reason cheaper restaurant makes less delivery order add delivery fee expensive

Unauthorized Transactions Through GrabPay Wallet,"This is the first time I get my money stolen by someone within 6 minutes. I am very sad and angry. I lost RM1500. GrabPay auto top up the balance into my wallet and transfer to Payer Max. I did not click anything or share anything. I was just playing games and suddenly receive a notification about there is a transactions made on GrabPay. I normally just use GrabPay for GrabFood. I have my debit bank account linked to it. The hacker manage to top up on it own and transfer/pay it without me doing anything. I received a Grab Activation Code(GAC) but i did not give it away yet the hacker manage to obtain it or bypass it.

Unless there's government enforcement, companies like Grab will go with the easiest path to get your money even at the expense of security. 

For example, if you go to an online site that accepts Grab as a payment method, the token they generate remains accessible to that site which means if that site gets breached, someone using that token could make payments using your account. 

Grab makes no effort to give you the tools to easily view or revoke those tokens through the app. || Don’t link or save any card details on app. Don’t trust them for security reasons || You most likely have some malware or dodgy Apps in your phone. Mind to list all your apps, we want to know what’s the app that is suspicious? || You can't transfer money without any user input or revealing/scanning QR codes. Perhaps you could let us look at your apps list and see if there are any apps that allow third party access by another person. 

Is your phone also password locked? Someone could have physically gained control of your device. || I'm really sorry for your lost || You have a Trojan horse in your phone. My wife also kena after she visited a frozen food website, she lost RM1500 from her Touch n Go linked to her debit card. || debit card? you might be out of luck

credit card? contact your bank RIGHT NOW


and people think i'm silly for refusing to install any e-wallet application on my phone || **Update:** Someone has the same case as me. The only different is that it happen with 6 transactions instead of 2 (Total amount: 1500) which is Grab daily spending limit. at today Jan 22 4:17am. 

[https://imgur.com/a/NQVy2v3](https://imgur.com/a/NQVy2v3) || I link my debit card but I did it in a unique way..I have an account from a digital bank that was launched in December 2022 called Rize. I transfer a small amount of money each time i need to auto-topup or topup my grab wallet or other ewallets, etc so even if I lose my money, I lose only what is limited in the Rize bank account.  


So I get convenience but no risk (other than losing the full amount in my Rize bank) which I limit what I transfer, and its not my main bank account. You can try that approach as well if you're worried in future this happens. Your case seems unusual and never heard of Payer Max. One possibility is with grab you can use another machine to key in your phone number and 6 digit grab pin but for first time it usually requests for OTP to verify but there's a possibility that the previously authenticated browser was not cleared (maybe you used it on someone else's phone or an internet cafe, etc).

For example, if you go to an online site that accepts Grab as a payment method, the token they generate remains accessible to that site which means if that site gets breached, someone using that token could make payments using your account.

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Menu Price Difference on GrabFood,"So, recently I noticed that the menu  items of a particular restaurant are different by ~RM3-RM4 on GrabFood compared to their in-store price. The thing is they explicitly mentioned that the prices are same as in-store on their menu page in GrabFood. I did saw a post similar to this in this subreddit. However, can anyone please tell what can be done regarding this? Is there somewhere we can report this?","There will always be a difference. Nobody will do a business where they lose money, Grab takes 31.8% off of everything in the menu, so if a restaurant sells for the same price as in store, they will be losing 31.8% of profit plus plastic for takeaway packaging.

Situations like this happen because some shops (advised by Grab onboarding team i guess) specifically print a separate menu just for Grab verification purposes.

I'm thinking about moving out of KL for less dense areas. Which small city is the best?,"I (30 M) have had enough of the 'urban lifestyle'.

Unifi availability at larger towns, like Taiping, is a given but be aware that depends on which housing area you're staying at since speed at some of the housing areas could be throttled due to the number of switches for that area could be limited and thus, lower average speeds. That does not mean you don't get the speed you signed up for as you will still get the spikes of speed to what you signed up for but the sustained rates are low.

Somewhat similar to Taiping is Muar, Johor. Do note that Muar is more prone to flooding than Taiping since it is located at the river mouth of Sungai Muar that empties into the Straits of Malacca. Will need to take that into account with the worsening climate situation. There are 2 other towns in Johor worth considering as well - Batu Pahat and Kluang. Batu Pahat is a larger version of Muar. It is set slightly further back from the coast but is built-up around the Sungai Batu Pahat. Kluang is further inland like Taiping.

If you don't mind a larger place, my hometown of Ipoh may be considered although prices are slowly creeping up towards KL prices. If you don't plan to regularly travel to the city centre, you can avoid a lot of the congestion as the suburbs and outskirts are relatively self-sustaining and even have their respective shopping malls. For example, there are 3 Aeon Malls in Ipoh and located in the Ipoh Garden suburb, Menglembu suburb, and Klebang outskirts of Ipoh.

Hey OP here, this is KL area.
I have already sent an email to Grab.
Edit: I finally opened the food. Picture in the linked word. I'm done.

So I ordered from a place called Epic Food Hall Mont Kiara,
1 Bolognese Spaghetti with a Coke
1 Sirloin Burger
1 Bimbimbap

Was charged RM 52.50 for the total.

Out of the 3, I only got 1 of the items which was Bolognese Spaghetti. Which was [saucesless.](https://imgur.com/a/NC8sYGv) Fucking hell.

As you can see in the receipt, I was charged a ridiculous amount in Rounding Adjustment. Which the total of said receipt is RM 46.33. 

I am honestly just stunned and the cashier's negligence in not thinking, shouldn't the rounding be... You know... A few cents? Not RM30??

Other than sending support a message, anything else I can do? || if foodpanda, i will immediately take screenshot of the food  
& send then request to live agent  
they are pretty fast  


i assume grab will have similar stuff too  
just make sure you have all transaction details  
the grab side (email or in the app) || get a refund, including for your sauceless pasta and don't forget to review them on grab and google (yes, I'm petty like dat)

That’s crazy. || Why do we still need to round up/down on payments when the payment is made online?

Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions,"hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please! 

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions","1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US)

But they have not been updating hazards recently like the recent floods...

Unfortunately there is not a single better alternative app at the moment. But you can try Google Maps.

You should look into where the closest clinics and hospitals are, in case anything happens. || Can only guess you're in Taylor's, Monash or Sunway U. Therefore:

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

You might find the night life there pleasing. || It's not difficult to go out and explore your surroundings on your own. That is how to learn more about any country you're in and the people.  

Don't expect everyone to spoon feed you information.  

Like another person mentioned, another way is to ask your other international classmates. || 1) speedmart, mydin as your initial ones, then check other big and small. For instance each have their advantage and disadvantage comparing big and small stores. For instance i found that the cheapest sliced cheese cost less at a local shop than bake with yen.  
2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat. I kept it simple, inexpensive and healthy so this saved time. || Dont eat seafood at local mamak tho, the price enter another realm aka kayangan. || You make it seem like we don't live in pandemic times...",22/12/2021,21,24.0,1640173200,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/rm3heg/im_a_new_student_in_malaysia_and_i_have_some/,"Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please!

edit: removed some questions 1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US)

But they have not been updating hazards recently like the recent floods...

Unfortunately there is not a single better alternative app at the moment. But you can try Google Maps.

You should look into where the closest clinics and hospitals are, in case anything happens. || Can only guess you're in Taylor's, Monash or Sunway U. Therefore:

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

You might find the night life there pleasing. || It's not difficult to go out and explore your surroundings on your own. That is how to learn more about any country you're in and the people.  

Don't expect everyone to spoon feed you information.  

Like another person mentioned, another way is to ask your other international classmates. || 1) speedmart, mydin as your initial ones, then check other big and small. For instance each have their advantage and disadvantage comparing big and small stores. For instance i found that the cheapest sliced cheese cost less at a local shop than bake with yen.  
2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat. I kept it simple, inexpensive and healthy so this saved time. || Dont eat seafood at local mamak tho, the price enter another realm aka kayangan. || You make it seem like we don't live in pandemic

Is there other Food Delivery better than Grab?,"Is there any other food delivery that is better than Grab? The reason why I am using Grab is because it is tied to Grab car which I mostly use, and since they share the wallet, it's convenient.

However, recently I am noticing something odd with how their app shows which shop is ""available"" or which is ""out of delivery area"", which I find concerning. Whether you're a customer ordering food, or a shop selling food, or even the grab delivery rider, I think it's something to look at. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking at other food delivery apps.

A bit of back story, I wanted to order food from a favorite shop, which is relatively near to my place. Unfortunately, I couldn't order as the shop is ""whited out"" stating it is ""out of delivery area"". However, I noticed some shops that are of similar distance are available. I asked their Twitter support as to what's the reasoning for this one, and they said that it's either lack of delivery riders in the area or ""due to weather"". It wasn't lunch time so it wasn't peak hours, nor was it raining at that time. They said that this is how the app automatically handles such situations. And because of this logic, the app suggests shops that are > 10km away, however it chargers delivery for the same amount as that of when the shop is just near.

This to me seems like a red flag if I am a food seller or a delivery rider on their platform. If I'm a seller, I would be mad if I found that the app is blocking me from getting orders on the pretext that the app assumes there's no delivery riders nearby. If I'm a delivery rider, I would end up having to deliver to people that are so far away, only to be paid a measly amount as delivery.

It doesn't make sense to me as to why they have the need to disable the shop. Why don't they just put a premium on the delivery charge like how they add premium to grab car whenever it's peak hours?

Does anyone still able to use GrabPay on modified devices?,"This is my previous post a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab\_wallet\_suspending\_soon\_for\_modified\_devices/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab_wallet_suspending_soon_for_modified_devices/)

I just wanted to ask: does anyone with Magisk still able to use or it's a no since 6/1/2021?

During that time, I still able to use even after 6/1/2021. But now, I can't anymore. Wallet is there with balance but grab just acted like it knows I'm using Magisk or has root, and prohibits me from using GrabPay. Grab even asked me for root access, which clearly indicates that the app is able to detect root. TouchNGo and all other apps are working, thus there's no problem with the Magisk Hide. 

It's been a while since I last used Grab so I'm not sure about this, hope someone could shed some light on this. If I'm not mistaken, few months back it is still working because I attempted to place GrabFood order and seems to work just well. 

Sigh, very inconvenient.","i have another android rooted with magisk with grab installed. i can still open the app and everything works as usual. did you install xposed? || [deleted] || Never. Never used xposed since I moved to using Magisk, haha..

I do have an app called ""Taichi"" and I wonder it causes the detection. I will try to remove that and see. Other than that, I have no more idea, since TNG, ShopeePay, Boost all working fine. And I didn't mess with my phone for quite a long time already also. || Much appreciated for the reply! Esp. on the root prompt, almost forget that it won't know unless granted, dumb me :facepalm: I used to think that it won't prompt for root access when it does not detect root .\_.

Then.. it's quite unclear already what's going on on my end. I haven't changed anything in my phone in the past few months, everything is literally the same. Magisk with MagiskHide and also custom package name, all untouched. Thanks for the info on VPN, yeah I'm not using a VPN.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/  
it was made last year, i dunno what happen to that website though. || one more reason why we need more competition in food delivery service || I tot Rafizi Ramli already started one?

Meniaga app, I think || In my area, we have ""business WhatsApp group"" consist of few nearby Taman. Never need to use Food Panda, and you can also help your jiran. || I should have explain more on the profit part in my post. My thought is not that it will not generate profit to cover any cost, but to generate enough profit to cover the cost. The only problem is I do not have their audited report thus no way to justify if the 30% is reasonable or was it marked up. Thanks for your feedback though",24/7/2021,0,11.0,1627140576,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/oqs7p1/proposing_a_community_food_delivery_service/,"Proposing a community food delivery service With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment! Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven.

""6.9 Refunds

(i) Online Payment Orders

You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order.""

Honestly this is dumb, what I pretty much understand here is that once a vendor has accepted your order even if the food isn't made, your money is theirs now and threes nothing you can do about it unless you threaten food panda with legal actions. || For context, I originally wanted to order A&W for dinner after I got back home from work, which I then cancelled after a few seconds since my friend offered to take me out to dinner.  I noticed that my TnG money was deducted and realise it was from foodpanda, i gave it a few hours before deciding I would raise a support case with a live agent to only realise they removed the option of connecting to a live agent and instead just shove a ""Send us your enquire and we will get back to you soonest possible instead of resolving the issue now"".  Just to be met with this. Ive tried contacting them through their email, but get similar copy pasta response to this.

Any way i can get back my money? Im a college student already trying to make end meet and my only source of income is my part time job which is bare minimum wage || Foodpanda refund is slow. I get my money back in around 14 days. But you need to keep calling their customers support || i think just query them everyday about the issue and preservere,   
pray that you get decent customer service executive that care enough to help you.   
panda always like this, if get bad cs = no refund/min refund. || Must got story....i got refund from FoodPanda and Grab everytime. Especially FP is lightning fast. || so how would the process be like then? How do i get started? || I kena once with panda like u. Cancelled coz ordered diff things coz initial order took too long. Tried call many times they said cant refund. Apparently seems like the people answer are just junior that being told blanket statement cant refund. After escalation i got my money back. 

In your case just report online kpdnhep that should be quick || Few ways, I believe they have a WhatsApp line and email address for complaints. I'd use the email route so I can CC FoodPanda and make them squirm in sweat.

But if Whatsapp is easier, go ahead

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them.

Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

The chicken were bland. The sauces were bland. Like no salt and seasonings at all. And like OP said, they only sell chicken and sauces. With price not cheaper than KFC. The batter was ok, I guess

If u can manage it right, it will be smooth

But humans are the most complicated things to manage, so it's always pain in the ass to deal with

Lastly, getting family/partner/friends involve it's a big no-no, which I very agree on

But if after hearing all that n the person has disagreement or doesn't buy your concepts, forget it.

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Wishing you all the best in your next endeavor.","Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story. Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.

Item ordered through Food panda isn't labelled as non-halal ,"Last week me and my friend went to the new Sunway Donquixote store and he bought an Ajinomoto Gyoza. After giving it a glowing review when he got home I thought why not get one. Ajinomoto website mentions that you can get one from Aeon and there was one near me.

I ordered one through Food panda since I can get it cheaper with vouchers but when it came it has different packaging from my friend's and it came from Thailand with no halal logo. Even the soy sauce ingredients mentioned it has alcohol. After a bit of digging the new Halal Ajinomoto Gyoza (that my friend got) launched in November while mine are manufactured in September.

Went to the Aeon and checked, it's not in the non-halal section but they said that to take the refund issue through Food panda. Asked through the Food panda customer help chat and it said to use the 'Halal' tag on the search function which doesn't exist (AI?) and said that a refund is ineligible since I received the ordered item. Asking in here for thoughts and help.","Apa susah kawan?

in this case it is not on foodpanda to ensure that what you buy is dijamin 100% halal. anyway alcohol is not a blanket haram since jakim accepts a maximum of 0.5% alcohol content in the final product.

Thoughts on shopee food,"I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment?

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper.

What's a good monthly allowance budget for a University student?,"Malaysian University student. Lives at a hostel, even on weekends. Needs money for food, be it whatever eateries the University provides, Deliveries from restaurants via GrabFood, FoodPanda, etc., or just the convenience store. Maybe even needs money for laundry. Then, maybe they need to buy some equipment for their studies, say they need a camera or a new computer. What's a good budget for this student to get through the entire month?

Not including tuition fees, leisure activities, and any other unforeseen events that requires their money.","Man the way they teach math at school is useless... They should provide more real life questions like this.

Just my assumptions. Put into Excel spreadsheet and adjust according to own circumstances:

Hostel room with single person: RM600 (RM300-400 if sharing, RM1000 for more luxurious options)

Food: RM10 * 2meals * 30days =  RM600 
Filling snacks such as Milo and Biscuits budget = RM100
[Optional] occasional feast = RM200
Total = RM700 - 900

Utilities:
WiFi RM50
Electricity + water RM50
Mobile data RM50
Total = RM150


[Optional] Transport:
Parking = RM70
Fuel = RM60*2 refuels per month = RM120

Low: RM1350
Mid: RM1750
High: RM2250


I might have missed something. Just put into Excel sheet and edit as something comes to mind. Have some savings, and adjust excel sheet as expenses pop up. Reduce expenses if income not enough to support.

I assume you're asking for your kid, if so remember to consider if your kid travels back to hometown to meet you. If yes, need to consider in budget and maybe increase a bit for kid to have more leeway in spending. Ask him to report his spending and adjust spreadsheet if you're worried your kid bazir. Use the spreadsheet to find any suspicious spending. Budget using highest expected spending. Always budget enough, don't budget expecting to skip a meal or something. || I got 750 allowance monthly , but I save by doing laundry at my parents house , going back at weekends the occasional gas refill by them so I extrapolate roughly to 1.2k. Should say my location is Bangi. || For me, food alone is RM30 a day with a bit of leeway to go a bit higher or lower(Not more or less than RM5). This is only possible because I eat 2 times a day and I make sure I eat heavy enough to not lose or gain weight.

Basically, what I do is buy food from the closest Uni eateries and pay 8-12 for my first meal and 20-25 for grab food for my second meal.   Have to be smart to pick food from Grab to get the bang for my buck portion wise.

So, that's roughly RM900 a month.

Where got free delivery?  With panda pro you get free delivery with any order RM25 and above. If you dont have panda pro, KFC probably gives free delivery on its own. Usually the restaurant would have a pink message up top stating how much you need to pay before you can get a free delivery (its usually 25 or 30 ringgit). Make sure to update your app to ensure the message appears

I'm thinking about moving out of KL for less dense areas. Which small city is the best?,"I (30 M) have had enough of the 'urban lifestyle'.

And the workload is lower. So I'm thinking about resigning from the FT job, getting another remote writing gig and moving out of KL for small cities with good Internet coverage (preferably Unifi). 

My wife and I have no strong attachment to any cities or states (though I kinda like Taiping). As long as the area have Unifi coverage, we're pretty much set on our way.

Unifi availability at larger towns, like Taiping, is a given but be aware that depends on which housing area you're staying at since speed at some of the housing areas could be throttled due to the number of switches for that area could be limited and thus, lower average speeds. That does not mean you don't get the speed you signed up for as you will still get the spikes of speed to what you signed up for but the sustained rates are low.

Somewhat similar to Taiping is Muar, Johor. Do note that Muar is more prone to flooding than Taiping since it is located at the river mouth of Sungai Muar that empties into the Straits of Malacca. Will need to take that into account with the worsening climate situation. There are 2 other towns in Johor worth considering as well - Batu Pahat and Kluang. Batu Pahat is a larger version of Muar. It is set slightly further back from the coast but is built-up around the Sungai Batu Pahat. Kluang is further inland like Taiping.

If you don't mind a larger place, my hometown of Ipoh may be considered although prices are slowly creeping up towards KL prices. If you don't plan to regularly travel to the city centre, you can avoid a lot of the congestion as the suburbs and outskirts are relatively self-sustaining and even have their respective shopping malls. For example, there are 3 Aeon Malls in Ipoh and located in the Ipoh Garden suburb, Menglembu suburb, and Klebang outskirts of Ipoh.

A Rant About The Panda of Food.,"I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

I know I risk this post not being worthy or relevant to Malaysia or r/Malaysia but holy shit did I need an outlet. I am sorry.","About a month ago I tried FoodPanda. Came 2.5hrs later. No way of cancelling cos the whole app couldn’t even load the Help Centre. The food arrived with a receipt saying to prep food by when, so I know it had sat for an hour and a half. In between, estimated time kept changing and a rider was assigned 1hr before it was delivered. Rider went around the world but not collect my food. When I ask the rider, he said he immediately went to the store to pickup when receiving the request. 

Deleted it after that. Ordered in my office so my colleagues knew. And just recently, one colleague experienced status being delivered but food didn’t arrive. Went thru a few rounds of Helpdesk to finally get a refund. She sighed and said should have deleted it when it happened to me.

I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Grab Food atau Food Panda?,"Hello semua. Saya nak mulakan pekerjaan sebagai rider antara dua ni. Saya di Seremban. Manakah lebih berbaloi untuk dipilih dari segi pulangan harian, kelecehan bekerja atau lain2 hal. Harap boleh beri pendapat, terima kasih.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ms8j0t)","Hey, someone can add more stuff later or correct me if I am wrong, but afaik:

Foodpanda pay more, and it is easier since you only need to deliver in certain area only. Normally you can earn around rm3k to 4k+ (depend on place) monthly. But the problem is you will need to follow the timetable provided if you want to work. There is a limited amount of rider for each area, and once it filled up, you will need to do it somewhere else.

Grabfood seem more relax since you can switch on the delivery app anytime you want, but you will have to deliver stuff farther away. So you will need better Moto compare to FP. You don't have to deal with rainy day for GF since you can just switch it off when you want to, unless you are currently delivering something. As for pay, I think rm80+ in 6+ hours depend on place, which is slightly lower than FP.

FP has a weekly performance evaluation, which affect your batch. Your batch determines how much you get paid per order, starting from the lowest which is rm4.50 (I think?) to the highest which is rm7. GF have none of that. || I also want to add regarding safety:


Foodpanda.

1. You deliver stuff ""locally"" or in certain area only. 
2. You will have a timer which will affect your performances, which will affect your batch, which will affect your pay. 
3. You will get used to road conditions in that area after a few weeks, so you can avoid potholes, dangerous area easily later.
4. You will have to work even in rainy day after you filled your timetable.
5. You will have to deal with cash and deposit them at the end of the day.

Grabfood.

1. You will have to deliver stuff farther away especially on weekend since most rider will take a break in weekend.
2. You probably someday will have to navigate in an area that you never been before. Beside the fact that it is dangerous for you to use phone (GPS) will riding, you won't know how is the road conditions in that new place until you get used to it.
3. You don't have to deal with rainy day or peak hours if you want to, or at least until you get better at it.
4. Since you may deliver stuff farther away, you have to make sure that your motorcycle is in good condition. It is very annoying if your ride broke down in the middle of somewhere that you had never been before.

Side note: you will have to carry cash for Foodpanda. Although it doesn't happen often, but there are cases where riders got robbed. My friend told me that in most cases, the perpetrator will ordered KFC/MCD up to rm300 and ask you to deliver to quiet place. You won't have to deal with this stuff since grabfood don't accept cash.

Oh and if you choose grabfood, you can choose between being a Halal rider or non halal. Check your area first. Most places it will better for being halal rider. In certain area, both can give you decent amount of delivery. If you work in that area and choose non halal, you won't receive order from KFC/MCD/etc. Which can be better since you don't have to deal with KFC/MCD order in peak hour which can delay you for a bit. || [removed] || Thread nuked.

Foodpanda pay more, and it is easier since you only need to deliver in certain area only. Normally you can earn around rm3k to 4k+ (depend on place) monthly. But the problem is you will need to follow the timetable provided if you want to work. There is a limited amount of rider for each area, and once it filled up, you will need to do it somewhere else.

Grabfood seem more relax since you can switch on the delivery app anytime you want, but you will have to deliver stuff farther away. So you will need better Moto compare to FP. You don't have to deal with rainy day for GF since you can just switch it off when you want to, unless you are currently delivering something.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

…………………………………………………………..

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

o Encik Hanafi, pegawai di Kedutaan Malaysia di NY

Setingggi-tinggi penghargaan dan terima kasih juga kepada :

Itulah tempat saya merujuk dan mencari ilmu kesihatan terutama sekali pada waktu dunia diancam wabak ni.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

o Encik Hanafi, pegawai di Kedutaan Malaysia di NY

o Host saya, Ruz yang awesome and her father Uncle Suffian

o Bobby dan seluruh building management team

o Abang guard yang selalu tolong hantar barang sampai depan pintu

o Abang2 Grabfood dan FoodPanda

Tak lupa juga kepada wardmate saya S, N dan Kak L. you gais are osemmmm...keep on fighting k!!

Setingggi-tinggi penghargaan dan terima kasih juga kepada :

seluruh warga KEMENTERIAN KESIHATAN MALAYSIA dan Hospital Sungai Buloh diatas pengorbanan dan usaha tanpa jemu dalam memerangi wabak Covid-19, dan memberikan servis yang terbaik kepada kami rakyat Malaysia.

Dan juga kepada doktor2 yang tanpa jemu memberi nasihat percuma kepada rakyat Malaysia di sosial media. Itulah tempat saya merujuk dan mencari ilmu kesihatan terutama sekali pada waktu dunia diancam wabak ni. Terima kasih Dr Rusyainie Ramli, Dr Sakinah, Dr Imelda, Dr Erna Nadia, Dr Hana dan banyak lagi para doktor dan jururawat yang banyak berkongsi ilmu. Serta team Public Health Malaysia, PQ Community, The Dressar, TheDiagnosa dan banyak lagi page berkaitan kesihatan yang lain.

Terima kasih semua!!

la mak dah kata tak payah pi gatai nak pi jugak kan dah kena dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak rindu anak tak mesti la rindu tapi saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak tak boleh mengeluh tanggungjawab itu penting sampai hospital terus ke ward b tukar baju mulakan prosedur doktor datang interview tanya sejarah perjalanan tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya part ni paling penting kena jujur sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain pada frontliners pada seluruh warga kkm pada masyarakat pada kerajaan malaysian yang awesome bodek sikit jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di nyc sendiri dan doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom yakni pada mac maka ketika saya tiba di hospital itu adalah hari ke saya bersama cik corona owh lupa nak cakap saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya penting syarikat saya bekerja memang ada special taskforce untuk manage hal berkaitan covid hai ridhuan hai farina selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor buat chest xray dan ambil darah check blood pressure body temperature dan oxygen level chest xray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak walaupun saya tak ada symptom menurut doctor itu adalah prosedur sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru jumpa kawan baru di ward n dan kl baik belaka siap ada whatsapp group dah dan follow di socmed april jam pagi doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test result mungkin dapat within hours ok doctor saya yang menurut perintah mean time teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss smell saya tak perlu makan apa ubat saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je habis pulak tu haha ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital sg buloh untuk buat test waktu saya tulis ni result masih belum dapat lagi april alhamdulillah latest result adalah negative jadi saya dibenarkan keluar dan wajib kuarantin diri lagi selama hari untuk pastikan saya betul bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang hari saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan pkd semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah tapi lagi sedih kalau apa terjadi pada keluarga saya jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin demi insan tersayang dan negara tercintatakpe kejap je hari tu jom layan money heist pulak sambil buat kerja itulah serba sikit kisah saya saya bersyukur kerana allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat sebagai seorang yang telah pulih saya sentiasa berdoa semoga allah swt memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit covid yang lain yang sedang berjuang saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih insya allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma semoga cepat sama dapat balik bersama keluarga perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan tersayang ni bukan main saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu tinggalkan anak percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan yang berhati mulia mengambil berat tabah ikhlas dan penyayang saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini jadi di kesempatan ini juga saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya terima kasih yang tidak terhingga semoga allahswt sentiasa

PSA: Price difference between FoodPanda and GrabFood,,"This screencap is from today 30/05/2019.

Grabfood may have very attractive subscription plans and promos, but ultimately their price hike is too much. If you have no promo codes, consider comparing prices as Grabfood will most likely be higher (approx 30%). This is consistent across more than three vendors I've personally ordered from so do your research as well. Sometimes even with promo codes, Foodpanda comes out to be cheaper. As Grabfood also commonly have a minimum, consider Foodpanda if you often do take out for one. Don't be blindly attracted by promos, as it's not always cheaper.

If you have a shopback account, Foodpanda is eligible for cash back as well.

If you are used to Grabfood, currently they have a voucher code that is rather good (EasyEats), thanks u/KuzaSasuke for the tip! But once this promo is gone, to Food Panda I will go.

TL;DR: **If you have no vouchers, avoid Grabfood at all cost.** || thats why I prefer standard fast food delivery. || GrabFood's item price is higher than Foodpanda's total. I have never used GrabFood, but from this it looks like I never will. || Would the difference be because of the Brown Sugar Warm Pearls? Or is the foodpanda order truncated? || Didn't know this one drink can cost me a full dinner of KFC for two || Which one provides better service? Never used either one before. || Good to know, thanks for share || Yeahhh grabfood is pricier so I dont prefer them. I use foodpanda more. || Tealive recently increase their pricing on GrabFood for some unknown reason, maybe because of the commission percent set by Grab which cause them to increase the pricing. I always use GrabFood because I also gain Reward point which can be used to buy deals either for GrabCar or other brands. || I tried More Fun once.

GrabFood Tips,"Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Wrong delivery

&#x200B;

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

&#x200B;

* You can get partially refunded for an order that was wrongly fulfilled. Was expecting tips on ordering or using GrabFood but found 2 cases of complaints instead. || r/unethicallifeprotips || My friend cheated by FoodPanda. I Sent voucher(first time user) to friend. Friend use first time user code, but restaurant cancel order because some items not available. However, the first time coupon considered ""used"" and they dont give you a coupon replacement because my friend account considered not first time use anymore!!. Food Panda penipu scammer!!! || Case #1, you can save your dinner. It will be delivered instead of burn at the restaurant.

Case #2, you can get a refund. Many people will just let it slip when it is your right to claim what you ordered. 

Just sharing tips on how to use these apps better || That is not a scam. Other people use the code without issue. It's just an issue, which your friend should take up with FP. || I used GrabFood all the time while at Jakarta, Hanoi and Manila and they do work fine without any issue - the food gets delivered on-time and the right orders. Maybe those places are used to the service culture due to being real tourism-centric cities. Seems like hit-and-miss for different countries or localities. || Already did. Bodoh Food Panda CS says the code already used, no replacement, cant do shit. So yeah, Food Panda penipu scammer.  || Grab and Gojek are a lot better in Indonesia than Malaysia. Grab sucks shit here in comparison. || Wow. Got FoodPanda rider and CS here plotek and downvote me! Lol. Later i give nasty rating in Google Playstore to FoodPanda.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

GRAB getting worse ☹️,"I have been using Grab for YEARS but recently,Ithe service has gone from bad to worse..Delivery charges are ridiculous..Drivers now accept ONLY if ride faress are high..Then they cancel 🙄..Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded..Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours..Food & mart prices are higher than outside market prices..And the choices are so limited..Some drivers are RUDE..It's come to the point,I avoid Grab as much as possible..Also,they accept the rides,then DON'T move till i get so fed up,I cancel 🤬","You can read up on “platform decay” or Enshittification. What you’re describing is baked into the business model - they were never sustainable at low cost, good quality service.

For what it’s worth, I now only use foodpanda for food delivery and take airport limo from airport but for the most part we’re stuck with a monopoly. || I really hate drivers trying to make us cancel instead of them cancelling. They just hang around and not moving. I was not giving up, I used another phone to book a ride, let the first driver wait 2 hours before telling them they lost 2 hours of their lives waiting for me to cancel || BOLT BOLT BOLT, all the older and smarter drivers have switched to Bolt/indrive/maxim. || A few days ago, the fare for pickup from my house was RM60+ and rising. Then I changed the pickup location to the opposite street, my neighbour's, and the fare dropped to RM30+. 

THEIR ALGORITHM PURPOSELY PUT HIGHER PRICE IF PICKUP FROM HOME! || Just look up the distance between your location and your destination, deduct 20% from your total fare and divide it by the KM. That's how much the driver gets per KM. If it's less than RM0.90 - RM1/KM, be prepared to encounter problem like getting stood up. 

Based on my own experience as a part time driver, out of 30 jobs,maybe only 2 or 3 i got RM1 or more/KM. On average it's RM0.70/KM sometimes even RM0.60/KM. That's the reason the service is getting worse. It's proportionate to the price which is super cheap. If you choose Grabcar Plus, it's very rare for this to happen if any because of the higher price. || So far I have good experience for Grab Food but I guess I live in an area where there are a lot of delivery riders. I order a lot of Grab food a month (circa RM700-800) as I get some sort of allowance from company (due to remote work).

Get ppl hooked in their services, by sustaining massive losses.

That's how much the driver gets per KM. If it's less than RM0.90 - RM1/KM, be prepared to encounter problem like getting stood up. 

Based on my own experience as a part time driver, out of 30 jobs,maybe only 2 or 3 i got RM1 or more/KM. On average it's RM0.70/KM sometimes even RM0.60/KM.

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

Grab Account Suspended?,"My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

Funny thing is, they told her she got outstanding payment but there isn't any guidance on how to pay it, but also her account is suspended so she can't even login to Grab app.

So what's the quickest way to contact Grab support? And how did my mum even got outstanding payment if she only use cash payment on delivery?

The rider also told me to not pick up the CS’ calls because I think he wanted to scam me and said that I didn’t pay.

I call this number everyday to bug them about fares LMAO || Thanks for the info, I've been waiting for them to get back to me, did they told you how much you owe? How would they know if you paid or not? Send the transaction receipt to them? || LOL nice nice, will give it a try, thanks man!","Grab Account Suspended? My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

Funny thing is, they told her she got outstanding payment but there isn't any guidance on how to pay it, but also her account is suspended so she can't even login to Grab app.

So what's the quickest way to contact Grab support? And how did my mum even got outstanding payment if she only use cash payment on delivery? Or did my mum just somehow activated some online payment stuff and incurs debt? Just call I guess +603-27881300 || wen u hav pending payment it wil be highlighted in yellow , with a exclamation mark , all u need to do is click and top up ur grab wallet or pay thru card

Since April 21. I ordered a whole cake from SR. I paid in cash but I think the rider said I didn’t pay because the map was still showing in app when I was busy cutting the cake. It didn’t say the transaction was completed like usual but I did get a receipt through email.

The rider also told me to not pick up the CS’ calls because I think he wanted to scam me and said that I didn’t pay. 

I have the same problems as you. Can’t contact anyone. There’s only a page to make an appeal. I was rejected once and was ignored for the second appeal. I just made my third one. I only got a message saying I have to settle an outstanding amount after the first appeal.

Now I know that I can’t trust these food delivery riders now. I’ll just use grabpay wallet instead of cash next time to pay. Freaking thieves and even had the audacity to get me suspended.

Edited || Oh where you get that? I've been looking for a hotline number but just cant seem to find one appropriate. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face) || Problem is, my mum can't even login to her grab account, it just said account suspended. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) || Update: I managed get a hold of a CS speaker from a number given by another commenter. The CS told me that grabfood no longer does spoken customer service to customers, only through chat. 

But after all that, he was kind enough to tell me to send another appeal and make the outstanding payment to this account.

"M'sian Grab Driver Eats Cake Which Was Damaged During Delivery, Garners Sympathy From Netizens | WeirdKaya",,"I believe that tipping culture when done through 3rd party apps (Grab and others) will invite more problems.

Correct me if im wrong but if I don't tip the Grab driver or give low tip, can they know? Wouldn't that make them rate me lower than 5* even though my behaviour is civil while in their presence.

Wish the grab drive more successful delivery and get customers who tip big in cash. ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26558) || I want to feel bad, I do. Knowing the struggles of having no choice but to work with what you can do and can earn in this ever increasing price hikes economy. The customer can't fully be at fault too, maybe it's a birthday cake for someone so it has to be presented nice, but then if you really adore the person you would have went out and bought it yourself tbh. If they reject it cause they can't put it on Instagram for clout, shame on them.

However, we don't know how the drive drove. Knowing how majority of the grab drivers are speeding past you in lanes, taking corners dangerously, rushing orders cause the restaurant was late knowing they survive on number of trips made.

There many sides to the story that we can't see. Was the person who ordered the cake entitled? Possibly. Was the rider going fast and the cake moved a lot in the bag? Possibly. We just don't fully know what happened is what I'm saying. || [removed] || Story sounds fake. Customer ask him pay back RM 60 for ""damaged"" cake and he do it and wife just happens to capture him on video eating cake sadly? || [deleted] || its kinda sad to see that rider eating a deformed cake

its not his fault though, just trying to make ends meet only for his family

and the customer whos order it, its not wrong either || >Muhammad Fadzil added the RM60, which he had borrowed from his sister, was a huge burden for him as it was the end of the month and his child’s baby formula had run out.

In the grand scheme of thing, the cake issue is irrelevant.

He needs a different job. || We already have a tipping culture via service tax if you think about it.

Price of food at a restaurant is ingredients, time to make and serve, (maybe environment) That's why your Char Kueh Teow at the road side cost like RM7 but in restaurant like Little Penang at KLCC/IKEA is RM18+. That's on menu price.

Then the service tax is for? Their tips obviously. But somewhere along the way owners decided to pocket it too. Anyone who work as a wait staff don't see any extra money when the shop is busy. Just more fatigue at the end of day.

It's the same shit with that credit card charge too. It's supposed to be for the store cause they pay for that particular service, but who pays for it? The customers obviously. || As a grabfood rider, I don't care much if my customer didn't tips me (grateful if they were) its didn't affect how i rate them as customer.

Such as a) decentivise companies to increase wages. b) increase the number of people opt in gig economy (which I think should not be for individuals that CAN work a normal office job) and c) I feel like it gives incentives for the driver to grade us.

Correct me if im wrong but if I don't tip the Grab driver or give low tip, can they know? Wouldn't that make them rate me lower than 5* even though my behaviour is civil while in their presence. And if I'm rate lower than 5*, then I would get bad/unsafe drivers.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on.

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper.

What's a good monthly allowance budget for a University student?,"Malaysian University student. Lives at a hostel, even on weekends. Needs money for food, be it whatever eateries the University provides, Deliveries from restaurants via GrabFood, FoodPanda, etc., or just the convenience store. Maybe even needs money for laundry. Then, maybe they need to buy some equipment for their studies, say they need a camera or a new computer. What's a good budget for this student to get through the entire month?

Not including tuition fees, leisure activities, and any other unforeseen events that requires their money.","Man the way they teach math at school is useless... They should provide more real life questions like this.

Just my assumptions. Put into Excel spreadsheet and adjust according to own circumstances:

Hostel room with single person: RM600 (RM300-400 if sharing, RM1000 for more luxurious options)

Food: RM10 * 2meals * 30days =  RM600 
Filling snacks such as Milo and Biscuits budget = RM100
[Optional] occasional feast = RM200
Total = RM700 - 900

Utilities:
WiFi RM50
Electricity + water RM50
Mobile data RM50
Total = RM150


[Optional] Transport:
Parking = RM70
Fuel = RM60*2 refuels per month = RM120
Total = RM190, round to RM200 for safety



TOTAL:
Low: RM1350
Mid: RM1750
High: RM2250


I might have missed something. Just put into Excel sheet and edit as something comes to mind. Have some savings, and adjust excel sheet as expenses pop up. Reduce expenses if income not enough to support.

I assume you're asking for your kid, if so remember to consider if your kid travels back to hometown to meet you. If yes, need to consider in budget and maybe increase a bit for kid to have more leeway in spending. Ask him to report his spending and adjust spreadsheet if you're worried your kid bazir. Use the spreadsheet to find any suspicious spending. Budget using highest expected spending. Always budget enough, don't budget expecting to skip a meal or something. || I got 750 allowance monthly , but I save by doing laundry at my parents house , going back at weekends the occasional gas refill by them so I extrapolate roughly to 1.2k. Should say my location is Bangi. || For me, food alone is RM30 a day with a bit of leeway to go a bit higher or lower(Not more or less than RM5). This is only possible because I eat 2 times a day and I make sure I eat heavy enough to not lose or gain weight.

Basically, what I do is buy food from the closest Uni eateries and pay 8-12 for my first meal and 20-25 for grab food for my second meal.   Have to be smart to pick food from Grab to get the bang for my buck portion wise.

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Is there other Food Delivery better than Grab?,"Is there any other food delivery that is better than Grab? The reason why I am using Grab is because it is tied to Grab car which I mostly use, and since they share the wallet, it's convenient.

However, recently I am noticing something odd with how their app shows which shop is ""available"" or which is ""out of delivery area"", which I find concerning. Whether you're a customer ordering food, or a shop selling food, or even the grab delivery rider, I think it's something to look at. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking at other food delivery apps.

A bit of back story, I wanted to order food from a favorite shop, which is relatively near to my place. Unfortunately, I couldn't order as the shop is ""whited out"" stating it is ""out of delivery area"". However, I noticed some shops that are of similar distance are available. I asked their Twitter support as to what's the reasoning for this one, and they said that it's either lack of delivery riders in the area or ""due to weather"". It wasn't lunch time so it wasn't peak hours, nor was it raining at that time. They said that this is how the app automatically handles such situations. And because of this logic, the app suggests shops that are > 10km away, however it chargers delivery for the same amount as that of when the shop is just near.

This to me seems like a red flag if I am a food seller or a delivery rider on their platform. If I'm a seller, I would be mad if I found that the app is blocking me from getting orders on the pretext that the app assumes there's no delivery riders nearby. If I'm a delivery rider, I would end up having to deliver to people that are so far away, only to be paid a measly amount as delivery.

It doesn't make sense to me as to why they have the need to disable the shop. Why don't they just put a premium on the delivery charge like how they add premium to grab car whenever it's peak hours? It's their delivery riders' prerogative if they want to take the delivery or not. The shop gets their orders, the delivery riders gets paid extra, and the customer gets the food that they want, everyone is happy.","It could be that the particular restaurant disabled the GrabFood app from their side due to reasons e.g. not enough staff to handle both dine in customer orders and food delivery orders. || [deleted] || Try shoopee food, some riders/shops move over there( enjoying the honeymoon period), that might be the reason :-s || Try Beepit || Try AirAsia, Gojek and Food panda || I've seen AirAsiaFood. do they offer BIG points when you purchase from their platform?

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven.

Thanks for your feedback though","Proposing a community food delivery service With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment! Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/  
it was made last year, i dunno what happen to that website though. || one more reason why we need more competition in food delivery service || I tot Rafizi Ramli already started one?

Meniaga app, I think || In my area, we have ""business WhatsApp group"" consist of few nearby Taman. Never need to use Food Panda, and you can also help your jiran. || I should have explain more on the profit part in my post. My thought is not that it will not generate profit to cover any cost, but to generate enough profit to cover the cost.

Buying directly from digitally disadvantaged hawkers/food stalls around our area is one of the most straightforward ways we can support them during these challenging times. (Remember to keep the SOPs as you buy from them!!) We may be in lockdown right now, but the effectiveness of this map will be even greater once we're out of this period :)

This Google Maps layer compiles these stall's locations for us to easily locate them and drop by to support these stalls. (For now, only limited to KL and Selangor.)

**WHICH HAWKERS/STALLS?**

* Hawkers/stalls with owners, especially the elderly, who are less digitally savvy and cannot provide online delivery through apps like Foodpanda/GrabFood
* Hawkers/stalls that struggling to survive/are on the verge of closing down due to a lack of customers during this period

(You can start by looking at the ones in your own neighbourhood ;) )

E-Tunai Rakyat: A primer,"You may have read the announcement that the government has [selected Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets are selected for the e-Tunai Rakyat initiative.](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tng-boost-grab-selected-etunai-rakyat-initiative)

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

Source: [ Touch 'n Go FAQ,](https://www.tngdigital.com.my/etunairakyat) 

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities.",""" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card.

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)

I only make withdrawals if i decide to go somewhere that will require cash. || Boost reverted policies (changing cashback to coins) really making me wana uninstal the app, but then i got rm10 out of the blue, i mean i had to postpone my thought for now. || Touch and Go presented our company with an additional problem, used to be we blindly allow our sales and service team to claim TNG receipt, now we have them to itemize their spending and restrict it to only toll and parking if they want to use the app (one dude claimed over 1k via TNG, we found out he use the e wallet to makan) || TBH they should just unify TnG card and TnG eWallet. Saves so much trouble. || As I'm a heavy user of RFID/TnG Paydirect, I'll definitely choose TnG e-wallet.

GrabFood Tips,"Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)


","Alright || My experience is Grabfood and foodpanda is always always feeling bad for the food delivery guy, especially when it rains.  || It's a stapled-on business line, coz ""synergies"". What do you expect?

I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

foodpanda is great, man. || Me too. That's why I do not order whenever it rains.  || That’s a crap option. You don’t order the guys don’t get paid. If you feel bad for them give them a tip or something. I always tip the riders at least 5 bucks. If it’s raining and they delivered on time I would tip 10. Easy solution  || You have my upvote","My Issues with GrabFood Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

week sometimes daily spending fair amount money service quite shameful grab deteriorated quality service ever since uber decided forgo services buy grab shares list reasons grab utter shit even compared foodpanda appsystem error times ive ordered put screen process tracking page waiting whole order process updated nothing updated upon refreshing app get notified order could placedrestaurant available need refresh app like tracking page sometimes already heading restaurant suddenly cuts orders timer update without input ive also orders stuck order received long time suddenly food arrives multiple orders restaurant sometimes ive misordered restaurant resulted ordering twice said restaurant dont know grab cant offer restaurant group order one within certain timeframe instead making orders customer pay delivery charges paying delivery charges issue makes worse fact orders delivery people seems like waste time customers sometimes one drivers need stop someones house drop order take additional mins waste customers time also uses additional driver driver could taking delivery different area instead lack customer support cant remember grab used able inapp chat customer support like food pandauber eats remember button call straight grab customer support try sort orders cancel nowadays function way contact customer support app alone try use app link faq crap basically tell contact driver food order status think customers drivers responsibility call restaurants find whats happening regarding order go grabfood facebook find number call customer support even direct website couldnt find anything relating contact info dont know grab trying limit costs making hard customers contact support thus less refunds orders reducing customer support people general customer support service industry super important keeping customers notified happy super fail grab rating system find literally use rating drivers restaurants literally check restaurant listings restaurants listed ratings people small number people rating restaurant seems like every time rate order doesnt seem update system thought type info would useful customers since filter restaurants based rating seems grab doesnt really care food type classification one easiest things right dont understand difficult classify food properly whats use search food type function food typing wrong classified filter food pricing filter food pricing also correct example ie choose cheap pricing get sticky wicket pub medium pricing food threshold least define ranges pricing phantom restaurants sometimes theres restaurants appear list either open dont food inside list restaurant unable restaurants active sort food listed cluttering list loading restaurant list dont know since couple weeks back every time try refreshload restaurant list time load slow sometimes trying load lag app seems issue happens iphones since friends use android dont seem face limit previous order history app seems order limit previous order history reason people need claim meal expenses pay back friend previous order verify statements even check food ordered particular restaurant past orders theyre shit luck contacting facebook ask could email directly months order history exact reply orders stored system long period time history see app access reply email please advised currently order history visible last orders however take concern positively highlight higher management future improvement great job grab limit orders tldr things grab need improve rating system work rating system menu item like ubereats need able invite people share payment meals able favourite restaurant meal food maybe group together certain restaurants near group ordering maybe one order basket needed pay slightly extra delivery charge additional standard delivery charge per shopone driver needed classify food properly food type pricing alright experience grabfood foodpanda always always feeling bad food delivery guy especially rains stapledon business line coz synergies expect always preferred startups one thing one thing well happy dahmakan incessant marketing spam tldr judging organization length post rate pissed please

Food delivery peak during the pandemic, investors threw money at these businesses. Now, online food delivery stagnated, and some are on a decline. Most of them are bleeding cash. The only reason Grab is dominant is due to their other services supporting their food delivery service. || Got lah. Foodpanda service is actually much faster. Grab is slow as fark. Usually 1 hr delivery. But Shopee Food delivery mainly gone. Because shopee service sucks, if your food is gone...good luck...wait ding dong email for a few weeks.

Foodpanda still has best service with contactable live agents who take action immediately. Grab usually has more discounts options. || I think Grab isn't very good in terms of service, the food becomes cold upon arrival, long waiting time. || I prefer Grab too. FoodPanda is expensive. || Yes...all multi headed agents...like car salesman. Go to Perodua showroom, salesman will tell you he sells Proton too. Go to Proton showroom, salesman tell you he sells Perodua too. Went to Carsome...saleswoman says she sells everything. Including new cars...apa kereta lu mau? || Grab is dominating the market.

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof.

How to get unlimited voucher discount on Foodpanda,"**Late late update:**

This bug no longer works. Foodpanda team patched it on February.

If you still need to save on discounts, **just buy an Foodpanda account from shopee sellers.**

It costs around **RM 0.55 - RM 1.00** per account. When you got the account, just use **PANDABARU** promo to get discounts.

The promo code gives you a **40% off** on your order but with a **max cap of RM 10**.

Also! Remember to follow the instructions from the sellers. They usually wrote about it in the description section. 

Btw, you can see active promo codes and their details on the official Foodpanda website.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

You must have came across numerous Foodpanda account listings on Shopee, Lazada and others.

Some sellers price their services high, but there're still some who sell at a low price.

**But why pay, when you can do it yourself?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ljfrt5q8qkf51.png?width=4111&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8b00f0476f11a2d6fe55887e71719196a63d5f4

**Note: I contacted the Foodpanda technical team long time ago regarding this \[Invite Friends\] bug. But they straight ignored my message and emails. Perhaps they have earned enough money already by** **~~scamming~~** **refunds?**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Basically, this bug is like inviting yourself to the system. Getting both welcome and referral reward vouchers altogether.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**What kinds of vouchers will this net you?**

**You'll get two vouchers:**

* **First-order: RM 10 discount off ( Min. spend RM 20 excl. delivery and service fees )**
* **Second-order: RM 10 discount off ( same requirement as the first voucher )**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Steps on how to get infinite discount:**

1. **If you have registered a Foodpanda account previously with your phone number written. You must log in to the account and change the phone number.**
   1. Just change it to random phone number like 016-999-999
2. Create a new account on Foodpanda
3. After you have reached the page where it asks for your phone number. Just click  ❌ on the top-right of your screen.
4. Then the account will be successfully created without a phone number.
5. Now. Click \[ Invite Friends \] from the options panel.
6. Tap your referral link once to copy the link automatically.
7. Go to your phone's browser and paste the referral link.
8. **In this step, your browser should redirect you to the Foodpanda app automatically**
9. **Try other browsers if you have an issue with automatic redirection.**
10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**

10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**
* **The voucher expiry date is 1 month from the claim date.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Bug no longer works \] | They patched it on Feb**

* **See more details on the top of this post.** Your ""Please don't scam your local businesses!"" warning post sure sounds like an instruction manual.

Regardless - please don't scam your local food shops. They bore the brunt of low business during lockdown. || [deleted] || Update: I think I should have clarified something before posting.

I don't encourage anyone to abuse this bug. 

The reason I post this information to the Reddit is that I want it to become viral so that Foodpanda will finally take action to fix and stop this bug.

I have already contacted Foodpanda before, but I guess no one will take note of anything coming from the mouth of a beginner programmer.

My voice is literally too little, that's why I need everyone's help to make Foodpanda fix the bug.

A lot of Shopee sellers already earned RM 1000 or even more from selling accounts with this bug. 

I cannot just sit there and do nothing. That's why I decided to post on the Malaysia subreddit.

I'm sorry that I didn't state my purposes clear at the beginning. I just want to stop this damn thing and prevent any more innocent buyers to pay RM 7+ for a Foodpanda account. || Gameshark ke ni? || Dont work anymore || Thanks for the detailed tutorial || Reminds the trick to get free dinner plate back then for a month || The secret ingredient is crime. || I'm not sure thought...

I have told Foodpanda team about this bug. I even gave an array of solutions to fix this bug.

Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in KL?,"[SOLVED ]

Anyone know of any Deep Dish Pizza shops or restaurants?

Quick Google search shows Pizza Express in Petaling Jaya, but their reviews seems to suggest the quality isn't the best.

Anyone have any experience there?
They have a GrabFoods page

If anyone knows if any supermarket sells frozen deep dish pizza, that would be suitable as well.

SOLVED Edit: Mean Mince still offers Deep Dish Pizza but it's only available for dine in or takeaway, delivery has to be self-arranged, so that explains why you won't see deep dish pizza on their GrabFood or FoodPanda.

The price for one is RM 83 and there is 3 toppings to choose from:

Getting loved by Kedai Kopi Yee Fung after I congratulated him on GrabFood of his news.,," Story in the album & captions:

Getting news about Kedai Kopi Yee Fung's laksa getting ""Essence of Asia"" recognition, so decided to order from him. Added a congratulation in the special instructions to the boss and asked him if can add some freebies XD

Received a WhatsApp msg from the boss of Yee Fung. Boss replied to me saying ""Hi boss (everyone is boss in Malaysia), this is Kedai Kopi Yee Fung's boss. Thanks to your support, we have our achievement today!""

When I get the laksa, I thought ""Aiya no extra freebies..."" Then when I dig, actually a lot more prawns plus more other stuff hidden underneath!

Go and be nice to your food providers. Type something nice in the special instructions box instead of leaving it blank.

1. They will feel good about themselves and put more heart into making good food.
2. You could get freebies surprizes
3. They will make sure your food is prepared well. Nobody wants to disappoint a big fan.

Has this happened to you guys on shopeefood?,"I just ordered through shopeefood while at work for lunch and its just been saying “assigning driver for you” for the past hour.I have already made payment through online banking and its gonna take 1-3 days to get it refunded.Its probably cuz of the peak hour(lunchtime) but for an entire hour n still no driver? 

I cant exactly leave my workplace and im hungry with no food:(","Ya happen before. Its because they are cutting cost and less riders. During covid not even 2 mins needed to find rider. Now takes 50 mins. The riders are doing same day delivery and food delivery at same time. || Happened to me once too, over an hour, no rider, I scrolled down and they let me cancel it. But I think they'd automatically cancel it for you too if it's just idling there for over an hour. 

But I got my refund almost immediately, I withdrew my money and went back to ordering with grab because shopee food has close to no riders most of the time - especially when it's peak hour or it's raining (I used to work in fnb and our shopee device is literally dead - no one really orders from shopee hence why there's little to no drivers at all. The only damned device sound you'll hear on repeat is the foodpanda and grabfood one) || Many times if you are at UPM hospital. No driver. Grab has drivers. || Use spaylater next time so it’s not your cc or bank in money. I also kena many times then had to wait half hr before can click the cancel button. But shopee food cheaper with the vouchers and coin deductions. So i still try my luck each time 😅 || sometimes its the system. my friend who does shopeefood sometimes says the system assigns them stupidly far away pickup points or far away drop off points for short drop off points price. so all of the riders will just log off for a few hours.

so yeah sometimes the system glithces so hard that nobody wants to work. || There are no riders available. Or maybe riders rejected your order. Or maybe the system is f**ked.

U might better order a bit early if during peak time. || You should top up your Shopee pay and use it instead. Because once the order is cancelled, the amount are automatically debited back to your account.

I just ordered through shopeefood while at work for lunch and its just been saying “assigning driver for you” for the past hour.I have already made payment through online banking and its gonna take 1-3 days to get it refunded.Its probably cuz of the peak hour(lunchtime) but for an entire hour n still no driver? 

I cant exactly leave my workplace and im hungry with no food:( Ya happen before. Its because they are cutting cost and less riders. During covid not even 2 mins needed to find rider. Now takes 50 mins. The riders are doing same day delivery and food delivery at same time. || Happened to me once too, over an hour, no rider, I scrolled down and they let me cancel it. But I think they'd automatically cancel it for you too if it's just idling there for over an hour. 

But I got my refund almost immediately, I withdrew my money and went back to ordering with grab because shopee food has close to no riders most of the time - especially when it's peak hour or it's raining (I used to work in fnb and our shopee device is literally dead - no one really orders from shopee hence why there's little to no drivers at all. The only damned device sound you'll hear on repeat is the foodpanda and grabfood one) || Many times if you are at UPM hospital. No driver. Grab has drivers. || Use spaylater next time so it’s not your cc or bank in money. I also kena many times then had to wait half hr before can click the cancel button. But shopee food cheaper with the vouchers and coin deductions.

Looking for food recommendation in Kuantan,"I'm from Thailand and currently in Kuantan for Malaysia Coffee Week. This is my first time in Kuantan. I’m staying around East Coast Mall and Skytree Hotel, and I would like to get food recommendation nearby ideally within walking distance. If it's not walking but Grab reachable, I'm okay also.

I'm good with anything, Malay, Chinese, Indian. Any popular dishes or good places? Preferably dinner place for the evening.

Thank you so much in advance!","Welcome to my hometown! For food recommendations, you can try these:

1. Air Putih Cendol - You can order it on Grabfood, must-order if you have a sweet tooth
2. Mail Ikan Bakar - The touristy one is Ana Ikan Bakar Petai but my family prefers this one
3. Satay Zul - Best satay in town
4. Kam Loong Chicken Rice - best chicken rice and roast pork in town
5. Gerai Mok Naa - Delicious, freshly fried keropok lekor
6. Jaman Tory - Traditional Malay dishes like pekasam and ikan patin tempoyak is here, can order on Grabfood
7. Mek La - Kelantanese breakfast place selling laksam and nasi kerabu, this is a bit far and only accessible if you have transport
8. Hup Kee @ La Gourmet (in front of Public Bank) - Chinese yong tau foo with noodles and good coffee, can be a bit pricey but taste wise very consistent
9. On The Way Kopitiam - A new breakfast spot, this is a branch from Kuala Terengganu and features traditional dishes like laksa merah, a bit pricey and queue can be long
10. Pickers - A recent supper spot at Jalan Besar, serving local dishes and coffee, the decor is all about vintage items that Malaysians will definitely recognise

Have fun!

Edit: spelling || It's been years since I last visited kuantan, so not sure if these places still hold up. 

There's a noodle shop at teluk cempedak, Hoi Yin. I liked the curry mee.

Kula Cakes had a loooooong q when I went there. The mango cheesecake was the most recced item. There's outdoor seating has cute murals.

Someone told me that the cake is also available at this restaurant called Lila Wadi. I went there years and years but I honestly don't remember the food, so idk if I'd rec it. || ehmm.. coffee event in kuantan. Interesting (While I love coffee but I'm kinda waiting for Big Bad Wolf sale later in few weeks.). It's at East Coast Mall which is a food mall and located in a food-ish district here so you won't starve. I'm still trying out around the area, (for the mall itself, I've tried Banana Bros, Sushi King, Dolly Dim Sum and Dubuyo... it's practically what you usually get in Klang Valley) there's Vietnamese and Syrian food around too. 

Personally, I recommend the local east coast specialties if you can find them. Patin Tempoyak with Rice. Nasi Minyak with Ayam Masak Merah. Nasi Kerabu. Nasi Dagang. Keropok Lekor. Otak-otak. || mango cheesecake looks awesome.

I'm good with anything, Malay, Chinese, Indian. Any popular dishes or good places? Preferably dinner place for the evening.

Thank you so much in advance! Welcome to my hometown! For food recommendations, you can try these:

1. Air Putih Cendol - You can order it on Grabfood, must-order if you have a sweet tooth
2. Mail Ikan Bakar - The touristy one is Ana Ikan Bakar Petai but my family prefers this one
3. Satay Zul - Best satay in town
4. Kam Loong Chicken Rice - best chicken rice and roast pork in town
5. Gerai Mok Naa - Delicious, freshly fried keropok lekor
6. Jaman Tory - Traditional Malay dishes like pekasam and ikan patin tempoyak is here, can order on Grabfood
7. Mek La - Kelantanese breakfast place selling laksam and nasi kerabu, this is a bit far and only accessible if you have transport
8. Hup Kee @ La Gourmet (in front of Public Bank) - Chinese yong tau foo with noodles and good coffee, can be a bit pricey but taste wise very consistent
9. On The Way Kopitiam - A new breakfast spot, this is a branch from Kuala Terengganu and features traditional dishes like laksa merah, a bit pricey and queue can be long
10. Pickers - A recent supper spot at Jalan Besar, serving local dishes and coffee, the decor is all about vintage items that Malaysians will definitely recognise

Have fun!

Edit: spelling || It's been years since I last visited kuantan, so not sure if these places still hold up. 

There's a noodle shop at teluk cempedak, Hoi Yin. I liked the curry mee.

Kula Cakes had a loooooong q when I went there. The mango cheesecake was the most recced item. There's outdoor seating has cute murals.

Someone told me that the cake is also available at this restaurant called Lila Wadi.

Interesting (While I love coffee but I'm kinda waiting for Big Bad Wolf sale later in few weeks.). It's at East Coast Mall which is a food mall and located in a food-ish district here so you won't starve. I'm still trying out around the area, (for the mall itself, I've tried Banana Bros, Sushi King, Dolly Dim Sum and Dubuyo... it's practically what you usually get in Klang Valley) there's Vietnamese and Syrian food around too. 

Personally, I recommend the local east coast specialties if you can find them. Patin Tempoyak with Rice. Nasi Minyak with Ayam Masak Merah. Nasi Kerabu. Nasi Dagang. Keropok Lekor. Otak-otak. || mango cheesecake looks awesome. Cheers!","Looking for food recommendation in Kuantan I'm from Thailand and currently in Kuantan for Malaysia Coffee Week.

Received a WhatsApp msg from the boss of Yee Fung. Boss replied to me saying ""Hi boss (everyone is boss in Malaysia), this is Kedai Kopi Yee Fung's boss. Thanks to your support, we have our achievement today!""

When I get the laksa, I thought ""Aiya no extra freebies..."" Then when I dig, actually a lot more prawns plus more other stuff hidden underneath!

Go and be nice to your food providers. Type something nice in the special instructions box instead of leaving it blank.

1. They will feel good about themselves and put more heart into making good food.
2. You could get freebies surprizes
3. They will make sure your food is prepared well. Nobody wants to disappoint a big fan.
4. You will feel good too! || I miss Sabah Laksa so much!!

Foodpanda vs grab vs shopeefood,"Hi all, Im the one who always ordered food online to avoid people and i found that ordering online saves a lot of money using the voucher and i can also ordering in bulk and save it for dinner or tomorrows lunch. Ive subscribed to panda pro and grabunlimited before. Didnt renew last yr for grabunlimed since it doesnt seem to be worth if for the discount given. Renewed panda pro as it gave lots of discount but lately the voucher and discount keep on decreasing. So i dont think i will renew it once it expire. And now i saw grabunlimed have few interesting voucher. Should i subscribe it.

Foodpanda for my area charges ridiculously  higher expensive delivery than grab for the same store and distance. Plus, with delivery discount for rm20 above, I usually have free delivery. Used to be loyal to foodpanda when they had free delivery with no cap.

The price for one is RM 83 and there is 3 toppings to choose from:
