Is this normal?,Bought the Popcorn Chicken+Fries+Lemonade from Pop Meals (via foodpanda) for RM13.99. The fries portion is barely a scoop and 80% of em are small 😭.

Foodpanda Bicycle Rider Question,"Greetings all,

I am looking for specific insight on Foodpanda Bicycle rider. 

Anyone with inside knowledge on how this works or first hand experience would be appreciated.

I am referring to Foodpanda riders that specifically ride manual bicycles (not electric bicycle or scooter), as I have seen some of those before.

My question is how does this works exactly? In terms of how Foodpanda side assign jobs to those on bicycles seeing that if the job given is too far then it would be too impractical for them to pick up and drop off the order in a timely manner seeing that bicycle is not exactly designed to travel fast in long distances.

The reason I asked is I am pondering to try it myself but just wondering how it works before commiting to it.","Hi I used to do  foodpanda walker during mco. you need apply for foodpanda walker option when applying to them. Yes recommend youp get a bicycle or electric scooter you can do delivery by walking the coverage radius is small but it can be quite tiring. || Heya! r/Malaysia is currently conducting a sub census since our last one back in 2021!

Foodpanda wants you to BEG for refunds,"I know there are still a lot of Foodpanda users out here despite of their not so pleasant experiences when things go wrong on their orders. I am sharing this post as a tip to everyone so that you are aware of the current situation of things especially new users who doesn't have a clue. Here goes the list.. 

1.) They DON'T REFUND for OUT OF STOCK items paid by CASH VOUCHERS (lazada or shoppee). 
Their system only sees it as you are not maximizing the voucher value. YOUR LOSS = PROFIT TO THEM

Example buy 3 bottle of nescafe coffee but 1 bottle is out of stock. That out of stock is considered burn/forfeited from the original cash voucher and won't be refunded. Next time you want to order, make sure you go to the store and get confirmation from the store manager whether they have stock first before you order anything. 

2.) Customer service is non existent. 
Impossible to get live chat with live human agent. Suspect that all is running on AI chatbots which can spew scripted replies and close your ticket within 10 minutes or less. 

In the past, it is still possible to get a refund for 1.) because human agents are not mindless bots. 

3.) Facebook admin suspected to be a chatbot as well
The admin is always online and replies to your posts/comments with multiple language support and scripted replies very promptly. It is capable of deleting comments and also ban users who are CRITICAL about their services as well. In order words, your NEGATIVE posts on their Facebook would be deleted and you would be BANNED as a damage control if you continously comment on their poor services

4.) Reporting to KPDN / tribunal is not worth due to the small claim amount 
You still have to attend the tribunal hearing at their office and incur time cost by taking leave from work, parking, petrol, transport charges, etc. They know this so they would IGNORE KPDN threats from customers.

5.).... Feel free to continue from hereband add to this post about your BAD EXPERIENCE with them.

The objective is to remind everyone not to waste anymore time using their services as they wouldn't even care if you have to BEG them for REFUNDS or raise your blood pressures in doing so. In their perception, they have so much of customers that losing a few doesn't even make a dent in their profits.","Stop using foodpanda, shoppeefood is currently the best on the market. || Deleted the app right after pandemic. Faced various issues and had to follow up emails after emails for refunds and include so many justifications for their own mistake. Haven’t been using for almost 4 years!

However, if you live in Klang Valley you have alternatives, some outskirt folks only have this app as main food delivery. As much as Grab also has issues, it sucks lesser than FP 

The app sucks
The promo sucks
The CS sucks || I ordered dominoes, the app says its still on the way after an hour, we got fed up waiting. Turns out the app was frozen on the driver delivering screen, even after we refreshed it, we called dominoes, they didn’t end up delivering the food. We went to the actual store (we should’ve prob drove there in first place but I wanted to surprise my sis and bro in law since they are exhausted from work) and walla, our food was there at the back of the kitchen.

The workers there are like, we thought it was cancelled but you can still pick them up now? I was soo confused and pissed. But then I knew I’d be getting some cold ass pizzas if I took it, so a 80RM refund sounds more delicious. I didn’t take it and kept calling foodpanda and got the refund.

This is during the time I first started working and couldn’t get a cc so I was using debit.

Deleted the app after the refund. Never gone back to FP, not worth it. That is 3 years ago. 😊 || When you order food on foodpanda, there is an option on what to do if the item is out of stock. The default setting is ‘remove from my order’, but you can also choose ‘call me’ or ‘cancel the whole order’. 

Obviously the call me option is best, but if you choose ‘cancel the whole order’, your voucher will be returned to your foodpanda wallet. 

Granted, I only use foodpanda for food delivery, so I’m not sure if they have this option for grocery delivery. 

Also, I usually use the chat feature for problems with my delivery (food spilled, missing items etc) and usually get good resolutions. I mean, they usually refund the cost of the food item, I’m not asking them for more than the food cost. 

So I will take that voucher and use it for my next orders. (I usually ask for vouchers, not for refunds on my credit card. The money is already out of my account.. so the voucher is ‘free’ #GirlMath) || 4) credit card chargeback - I was successful. || Hahahah

Their Facebook is definitely automated || The issue here is no real human dealing with the issue. Sadly company nowadays want to cut cost, all uses AI to replace customer service.  || I use panda because it's a bit cheaper than grab. i don't have to pay for transport there and back. i don't have to deal with makcik membawang dan orang membebel. plus i can browse as long as i like without any trouble. 

when panda is being really shirty i get around the no cash refund by just opting for cash payment and then do QR or online bank transfer with the rider. Panda can't take your money if you never gave it to them in the 1st place. || Foodpanda has the worst refund. It took 14 days for me. Grab and Misi have an instant refund credited to your account wallet. Foodpanda refund backs to your bank so it took longer || Dang, never heard of any of this before. My fam and I use fopanda near daily. Never had more of a problem than drinks being spilled or wrong food item sent. Always got a refund when that happened or we'd get a voucher. Refunds were usually back into payment option withing a few minutes. We pay with tng ewallet tho. A few days ago, got the 2 for 1 deal from Marry Brown and instead of 2 lucky plates we got 2 nasi lemak. Talked with the chat bot for 5 mins and got a rm45 voucher.

Cancelled my order on FoodPanda and Still didn't get my refund,,"Pretty sure this falls under KPDNHEP authority to mediate. || Update: Contacted them via Insta page and went front and back a bit before they tried to ask me to wait 5-7 days, I told them i wont wait and will raise a dispute with them thru  KPDNHEP, they instantly folded and refunded. 

FoodPanda policy 6.9 is stupid as fuck.   
  
""6.9 Refunds

(i) Online Payment Orders

You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order.""

Honestly this is dumb, what I pretty much understand here is that once a vendor has accepted your order even if the food isn't made, your money is theirs now and threes nothing you can do about it unless you threaten food panda with legal actions. || For context, I originally wanted to order A&W for dinner after I got back home from work, which I then cancelled after a few seconds since my friend offered to take me out to dinner.  I noticed that my TnG money was deducted and realise it was from foodpanda, i gave it a few hours before deciding I would raise a support case with a live agent to only realise they removed the option of connecting to a live agent and instead just shove a ""Send us your enquire and we will get back to you soonest possible instead of resolving the issue now"".  Just to be met with this. Ive tried contacting them through their email, but get similar copy pasta response to this.

Any way i can get back my money? Im a college student already trying to make end meet and my only source of income is my part time job which is bare minimum wage || Foodpanda refund is slow. I get my money back in around 14 days. But you need to keep calling their customers support || i think just query them everyday about the issue and preservere,   
pray that you get decent customer service executive that care enough to help you.   
panda always like this, if get bad cs = no refund/min refund. || Must got story....i got refund from FoodPanda and Grab everytime. Especially FP is lightning fast. || so how would the process be like then? How do i get started? || I kena once with panda like u. Cancelled coz ordered diff things coz initial order took too long. Tried call many times they said cant refund. Apparently seems like the people answer are just junior that being told blanket statement cant refund. After escalation i got my money back. 

In your case just report online kpdnhep that should be quick || Few ways, I believe they have a WhatsApp line and email address for complaints. I'd use the email route so I can CC FoodPanda and make them squirm in sweat.

But if Whatsapp is easier, go ahead

They have a portal to make complaints [here](https://e-aduan.kpdn.gov.my/kepenggunaan)

The WhatsApp link and email is there too || Contacted them via Insta page and went front and back a bit before they tried to ask me to wait 5-7 days, I told them i wont wait and will raise a dispute with them thru  KPDNHEP, they instantly folded and refunded.

Foodpanda vs grab vs shopeefood,,"using all 3.

shopeefood - when wanna buy from short range vendor due to delivery voucher, normally spend rm15-20 for lunch & dinner. pros: no need to spend rm25 for delivery voucher. cons; delivery voucher insufficient to cover far vendor delivery fee. 

foodpanda - when wanna buy from short to medium range vendor, with delivery voucher and panda pro voucher, average spending is rm20-23, for lunch and dinner. (pandapro voucher - rm5 unlimited, rm10 x 3, 35% voucher x 5) , cons; sometimes 1-2 hour delivery time, no free delivery when spend rm100+

grab, same as panda but grabfood pro used to suck (zero food voucher) but now they give rm7 voucher for orders of rm25, average spending is around rm18 - 23, for lunch and dinner.

"Foodpanda rider spilled drink, no refund","Ordered two drinks from foodpanda. The foodpanda rider took a picture of the drinks being delivered before one fell, customer service said no refund.

They claimed they tried contacting me, but I didn’t receive anything. They insisted I was unreachable and closed the investigation.

I have a picture of the rider holding the spilled drink right there. If I were to spill them myself, why would he be holding the spilled drink for me to take a picture of.

Say what you want about Grab, at least the customer service there is less rigid. Grab would’ve just offered a refund. Foodpanda merely copy pasted the same response over and over again.","Rise dispute again || Keep complaining and don’t let them close ticket.

I might try mentioning KPDN next time i have an issue. || Amen. A similar thing happened to me, with one ordered item missing, and the pack was sealed. Complained to FP but they denied it, saying the same evasive shit. I called the shop back and was not answered.

Shoutout to the Amazing Grab and Foodpanda Abang Riders! 231124,"
Just want to give a shoutout to two abang riders near Batu Tiga today, at two separate chaotic traffic junctions where the lights were completely out, these two abang riders, one from Grab and one from Foodpanda, stepped up as heroes! Without hesitation, they became traffic controllers, directing vehicles with such a calm and systematic approach.

I don’t know how long they had been at it, but I watched them for about 15–20 minutes, and they were working tirelessly to ensure everything ran smoothly. They didn’t have to do it, but they chose to help, and it made such a huge difference. It was so heartwarming to see their dedication and effort to help out. It’s a reminder of the good in people.

Massive respect to these abang riders, true unsung heroes of the day!

Isu jalan di kawasan pandamas ampang,"Assalamualaikum.. gambar yang diatas ni gambar yang lepas laa yang lama.. ambil dalam googlemap dan masa ni tempat sembahyang india pun tak ada lagi. Okay baik saya nak cerita.

Masa ni aku tengah bawa foodpanda dan dalam masa sama lalu di jalan tersebut dan mendapati terdapat kesesakan lalu lintas yang agak sesak jugak laa.. nak jadikan cerita aku pun pergi la ke tempat sembahyang diorang dan tegur berkaitan sesak jalan dan MENCADANGKAN letak orang untuk kawal trafik.. trafik yang aku maksudkan ni bukan jalan sampai 2 ke 3 cabang.. cuma 1 cabang je arus pergi dan balik (sehala) dan banyak orang parking kiri kanan (penghuni pandamas) dan jugak jalan tu bukan jalan raya besar yang sambung negeri² penting.. selepas aku tegur dengan biasa nada baik dan genttle tiba² seorang kawan india ni bangun dan dekati aku seolah² macam nak ajak gaduh sambil berkata ""u dari mana? Haa u dari mana?"" Diikuti dengan seorang lagi kawan india pun berkata ""berapa lama u stay sini"".. aku pun jawap baru 1 bulan macam tu n salah satu kawan dia pun jawap ""u baru 1 bulan bla bla bla.. ini tempat sembahyang kami.. kwasan kami.. tempat sembahyang kami.."" aku diam dah pergi dari situ. Okay u all.. nak tanya baik².. aku tanya berkaitan jalan n cadangan tapi kenapa dia balas macam tu? Kemudian cara dia mulakan perbualan bukan dengan nada marah semata² tapi dengan keadaan yang menginginkan ketegangan (gaduh). Adakah saya berkata begitu telah menyinggung, menghina, mempersendakan, mempermainkan, memperendahkan agama dia?.

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible.

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas. 

","I think it's mainly got to do with the law where if a motorcycle gets into an accident with a car, regardless of who's actually at fault, the car driver has to lay up || Ah yes, contribute to self bashing. Then again i did choose to ride i suppose.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

And then channel these redundant people to work on something else. || Unfortunately, because we practice a racialist political system, every problem is seen with racial lenses.

So even if we know how to fix the problems with law breaking motorcyclists, there is very little political will to do it.

Most law breaking motorcyclists are identified as coming from a particular race. This means that politicians who are self-proclaimed champions of this race will defend them till the cows come home.

Beware of the TNG RM5 for RM120 Voucher Pack Scam!,"[Voucherpack\_June\_webbanner.png](https://preview.redd.it/mmja1gwe8g7d1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=697650458b9752541c61f26afcef564b3322127c)

I just fell for what I believe is a misleading promotion by Touch 'n Go (TNG) eWallet, and I want to warn others before they waste their money. Here’s what happened:

# The ""Deal""

TNG is running an ad in their eWallet app promising RM120 worth of vouchers for just RM5. Sounds amazing, right? I thought so too and quickly paid the RM5.

# The Reality

After paying, I received ELEVEN (11) vouchers, but here’s the catch that wasn't clearly communicated upfront:

* **Minimum Spend Requirements:** Each voucher requires a minimum spend to be usable. For example:
   * RM8 Prepaid Voucher requires a RM60 top-up.
   * RM6 Foodpanda Voucher requires a RM100 purchase.
   * RM40 CarInsure Voucher requires a RM600 insurance premium.
* **Short Validity Periods:** Most vouchers are only valid for 5 days, making it nearly impossible to use them unless you were already planning to spend a lot within that short timeframe.

# Misleading Marketing

The initial ad conveniently omits these crucial details, only revealing them deep in the terms and conditions. This kind of hidden information feels incredibly deceptive and preys on users looking for a good deal.

# Final Thoughts

It’s really frustrating to see such tactics. RM5 might not seem like much, but it’s the principle of being tricked that really stings.

Stay cautious, everyone!

What Can Outsider do When Friend is Being Abused by Her Parent?,"Sorry if my England isn't that good but I'm trying to help my friend but I am not good with Laws and Police Enforcement.. 

This is going to be a long story to this situation, I have a friend who is now 25, Female. She is living with her brother, and mother. We were friends since middle school and roughly 2 - 3 years ago. Her father passed away, and us (friend group) have been finding some weird things happening in her family. 

She has to work a full time job and go home to cook, clean, the house daily. And sometimes even until 10PM she told us she had to clean the house before sleep.(Had to sleep late until her older brother finishes his meal and wash his dishes). Her mother is unemployed and roughly at the age of 40+. And have been asking my friend to do all the house chores while mother do nothing.

  
Her mother has been fetching them to work daily and never allowed them to drive. They have 2 cars and one was new (bought by brother but the mother wants daughter to pay some). And we noticed some strange interaction with her family about 2 or 3 years ago (After fathers passing).

We went out for friend dinner to celebrate her birthday, 6PM. Her mother called her and scolded her for not ordering food for them (mom and brother). We asked cant his brother order foodpands? She told us ""AIyah, my brother doesn't know how to use these apps"". We were shocked, as the mother called her not just once, but THREE times during that day just to constantly rush her to order foodpanda over to them. 

Soon after when we were all slowly living our lives (work, graduation, away from hometown). She is starting to struggle to look for a job, which then my sister recommended her a new job position. She finally started having a stable social life and even got herself a boyfriend! We were so happy for her because we thought she might finally be able to move out from home. And this is where everything goes down.

Another day us friend group meet up we noticed her hand is having serious skin issues (gotten worse). And she told us its due to chemicals from the dish soap. And until now it has never been cured. We told her to stop washing plates or maybe wear gloves but she is not doing it. Fast forward to where she was dating.  The boyfriend bought her a dishwasher. But the mother was very pissed off about it. Saying that ""My daughter can do it why do we need this?"" The boyfriend explained it to the mother and she wasn't pleased about it. And slowly pressuring the daughter. Whenever they went out on a date and come back home before 10PM. the mother would scream at her and boyfriend. Scolding them and insulting them. Forcing them to break up. And that stopped them from going out on a date (Must bring the mother along).  


Soon after the mother knowing that it wont separate them. She started to blame my sister (And the company) By going to the company front door and scream. Saying they ""changed"" her daughter. Until they have to call the police. Soon after the mother never bring her to work. Threw her alone on the roadside and drove off. One day the mother said she is bringing her to work. But ended up going to her relatives house, and to the boyfriends house to fight with them. And to really make them break up, the mother beat her everyday after work until they willing to breakup. They ended up broken up. 

  
Today she didn't go to work again. She was locked at home and got beaten up by her mother again. The boss from the office never fired her because they want to help her. But does not know how. They wanted to call the police but are afraid she might have no where to stay after all that happened.  I am wondering what can we do as an outsider to help her, we tried talking to her for years but nothing has changed. This time it went too far and the police thing makes everyone worried if it will ruin her future... Anyone here have similar issues of living with an abusive family? How do you get out from it? How would you resolve this issue?","I would definitely report this abuse to the police. Your friend would be better off on her own if her family is taking advantage of her like this. Your friend deserves better. 

Also I respect your care and concern and it shows your upstanding character. || Right, okay, where do I begin. 

The Women's Aid Organisation has a lot of good resources for this, including this portion addressed to people who believe their friend may be suffering from domestic violence: 

What you can do
- Listen to your friend and do not judge. Assure them that the abuse isn’t their fault.
- Ask your friend what they would like to do and respect their choices.
- Share with them the WAO Hotline (+603 3000 8858) or SMS/WhatsApp line (018 988 8058).
- If your friend would like to take action, you can accompany them to the police station to make a police report.
- If your friend is injured and wants medical care, you can accompany them to the “One Stop Crisis Centre” located in the emergency room of government hospitals.
- If you are unsure how to respond, you can call us at +603 3000 8858 or SMS/WhatsApp 018 988 8058 for guidance.

Their website is http://wao.org.my and I would suggest familiarising yourself with their content too, so you can supply assistance to your friend if/when she seeks it. 

There are legal recourses- the Malaysian Domestic Violence Act doesn't just cover violence committed against a spouse, but also against an adult family member. If your friend chooses, a court protection order could restrict her mother from entering her place of residence, work, or coming within 50 metres of her. If a court decides there is a risk of a violent contravention of the protection order, it could also attach an arrest order to it, meaning if her mother does violate the protection order she would be arrested. The WAO also runs shelters for domestic violence survivors and can advise on all of this in more detail. 

On a personal level as someone who has experience of the abusive cycle, it is down to your friend to make the decision to leave. But she may feel like she has no choice and no options, which is where you can come in to assist with the options I've detailed above. However, escaping the abuser is only the start of the battle- pressure on survivors to brush abuse aside and ""not air dirty laundry"" is strong. It is vital that your friend, if she chooses to make this change, receive support both from mental help professionals as well as from like-minded communities, so that she doesn't get drawn back into her abusers' orbit. 

On a personal note, I keep a folder of my abusers' messages to show anyone who tries to tell me ""it wasn't that bad"" or to minimise my experience. It's a reasonably effective way to get people to shut up about what they know nothing about. || Seems like a classic case of abuse and the victim very docile. She has a job, her workplace wants to help her, she is financially independent. She can literally just walk away. Its up to her to choose. || Thank you for all the suggestions and Ideas. Fortunately the boss from her work company decided to call the police. She is now at the police station but that is all the information i got. (I'm not around her area) 

So far telling her to move out or be ""independent"" doesn't work at all. We have been trying to tell her that for years and whenever we say that she just ignores all of our messages. 

We soon understand that she is actually afraid. She once said ""If i ever stand up for myself, i might not have any family to go back to anymore""
I strongly believe she is afraid of losing her family and no one to lean on etc, which I can somehow understand since she grew up having little friends and always has to stay home. It's like how some parents will always brainwash their kids saying ""No one treats you better like your family"" Idealogy which so we all stopped telling her that and told her it was all up to her from now. and we said that last year... So it's been so long and things just got worse. || Video tape (as a records evidence in the future), as police wont do shit. The old mother not gonna change.   

The best, get out and living totally out of touch with the family, however, this required temporarily financial aid/ loan + strong determination. Have to move out and stabilize, plan it perfectly, get all personal belongings and documents and run.

The house is inhabitable in a human perspective, police not gonna solve it verbally with the mom, jail is unlikely too. || [removed] || I always wonder if the girl is their own daughther for cases like this.

I mean, do they kidnapped some random baby girl from hospital 2 decades ago that they have the ability mistreated the girl?

Like baby elephant that forever thinking the piece of chain is sufficient to trap them for eternity.

I bet she has been abused since eon and unable to think that she can escape just by calling the police. 

It is already at this stage, I don't think she has the ability to break the chain herself. I mean, she has already working, had boyfriend etc but she never able to do tiny rebellion at home. 

If you know neighbour that can record incidents that they witness, would that help in this kind of cases? || You can't change anything for her.. Only she can decide to move out and block them || As hard as it is, I would recommend you guys as a group of friends (and her boyfriend) get her out of the house if you can (without breaking any laws of course)  and get her to cut off contact. It won’t be easy especially for her, but as long as she is under her mum’s thumb, your friend will never get the freedom she needs. 

Strangely, my GF has a friend in a similar situation with an abusive mother. She works in a big furniture retail store and is forced by her mother to give her money from her salary and to do all the chores and gets regularly abused. Unfortunately, it seems to have affected her confidence so she’s stuck in an endless loop with her mother which is a shame because my GF always thought she was really talented and could do way more but is being stopped by her own mother || Brother I feel you but the first step is that she has to be willing to get out. From the sound of her family, it looks like she's better on her own. As to who would be willing to take her in, short term can't you look into temporary living situation with renting first?

What I'm concerned about reading this is that you guys seems to want to help, but if you have already talked to her for years, and she's not receptive of help, then it's all moot. Try to see if she actually wants out or not, what her worries are about leaving her current toxic environment, and take it step by step to see what can you do to help.

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

Ordering Foodpanda/Grab while it's raining?,"So my family have been having these doubts between us, whether should we order while it's raining..

My mother said do not order anything from them while it's raining, as poor those riders.

Me on the other hand, always gives tips (RM2-RM5) depends on how heavy it is, thinking that what if they don't have enough profits for the day. 

This thing has been back and forth, now I'm truly want to ask for people opinions, or even riders here would be better. Can we order while it's raining? Or don't order as we will be just endangering your life?



TL;DR (Malay) : Boleh ke tak order foodpanda/grab masa hujan? Menyusahkan atau mmg riders perlu duit walaupun hujan?","I always tip when it's raining. And. Importantly. Wish them a safe ride.

It's a job. Your mum should feel worse to stop you using the service and paying their fee. Unless your mum doesn't want you to order delivery - but that's a different issue altogether ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26557) || They are not charity workers or being forced. They do get paid.  They want to take the risk then it's their own decision whatever happens. || Should be ok, they are not permanent staff that get fixed monthly salary right || So to riders i can always message them say “sokay its rain no need rush” so they can just wait, but from their side, do they have timeout from fp/grab? || Eh you can. It doesn't matter, the pay is usually much better when it's raining. 

However, cannot guarantee your food will be delivered fast enough lah. Usually for me I'll stop somewhere if the rain is heavy or thunderstorm. || Given how hard they're having it (owing to the strike ytdy), tipping is decent. *Just be understanding to them if food arrives late*. I waited 2 hrs for a burrito since it rained otw, no reprimand needed.

You can try to order when it rains, however, the restaurant may cancel your order instead! Or most will say 'delivery will be back soon', depending on your area.

Tldr, I don't order when it's heavy and always have a plan B if I didn't bawa bekal to office. || If it rains heavily I don’t order immediately. If it drizzles i’ll order and make sure to tip even if it’s just rm2-5 || Hi, I'm a rider and I think you don't have to feel sorry if you want to order during the rain. The reason is that riders are given option to pause or continue working during the rain. Me myself, usually I would pause my shift if it's a heavy rain. Some other riders will continue working. But do expect delay because usually there are more riders that pause during the rain and all the active order will go to the riders that didn't pause. So please be patient if your orders are late. Also it would be appreciated if you could tip them because working during the rain is kinda dangerous and tedious because some malls will not allow riders to wear their rain suit inside and we need to take off the rain suit before entering and then put in on again before delivering the orders. Anyhow don't feel guilty ordering during the rain as the riders that choose to continue working during the rain expect the orders to be non stop and it's beneficial for them. || Don't. As a rider myself, one thing is, yes, safety, but your food will be extremely late and by the time reach you, dah tak sedap. Who wants to eat soggy , cold, fries or noodles. || If it rains, I always tip the rider... I think its the fair thing to do.

Foodpanda Refunds,"Hey all! i figured i’d come here for advice.

I ordered food through foodpanda this morning and the restaurant called me saying their items were out of stock. Then proceeded to cancel the order and they agreed. Foodpanda agent then called me saying that they will not refund me considering the restaurant has prepared my order. I proceeded to tell the agent that the restaurant themselves told me they were out of stock, how could have they prepared it? And then the agent told me to claim through the app and she will refund it for me. I have then tried to talk to live agents and two different agents told me i am not able to be refunded considering the restaurant has already prepared the food and it’s a waste. To confirm their statement, i called the restaurant if they have prepared it and they said they didnt prepare anything. I’m at a loss and pretty upset that this happened. Any advice would really be helpful and appreciated deeply.

Sincerely,
A broke college student","Email them again with all the details and timeline, but this time u cc kpdnhep || Yeah, next time use other delivery services. GrabFood customer service is great, and refunds you less than 30mins. However, highly expensive and grabfoodunlimited deals are actually limited.

My collegue uses ShopeeFood a lot and its super cheap compared to GrabFood if you compare the same store prices. In addition, if you are familiar with Shopee's coupon discount, there are tons of it in ShopeeFood. We usually buy bulk for lunch in office and got discount up to rm30! I don't have any experience with ShopeeFood CS so can't comment on that. || not the first time I saw complaints about foodpanda customer service, just avoid using them next time.

I avoided foodpanda since they outsource their agents, who have no idea what they are doing at all. Solely used grabfood, refund process takes 5-10 mins only after submitting claim. Their customer service also local people, with proper english. || I stopped ordering from Foodpanda. Always GrabFood.

Twice, I have ordered at a restaurant that is still available in GrabFood but they are actually closed permanently. I cancelled my order and got my money back. || Report to kpdnkk, don't waste time with those stupid foodpanda cs || Hey OP, I've previously faced issues with foodpanda before. Pretty much just file a complain to  kpdnhep and they will handle the rest for you. I was contacted by foodpanda CS team after about 3 weeks, issued me a refund + a voucher || Foodpanda is the worst for getting refunds. Even if you get a valid refund (like food damaged, I kena they deliver so bad drink spillage all over my food) they will nickel and dime you. Meanwhile Grab will just terus give you the refund as long as can provide the pics and stuff. So I always go grab now since a few months back.

Not to mention foodpanda some of the deals and offers won't apply to you or they will just hide from your account. Really waste of time and money. The deals and offers look really good la which is why it is appealing but really not worth it in the long run everytime got issues. || Did you initiate the cancellation or did the restaurant initiate the cancellation? || Pernah order makanan tapi tak sampai masa pkp dulu. Chat dengan CS, the first guy kata makanan dah sampai tak boleh refund etc., then left probably because he ended his shift or something idk, and another person replace the guy (can see the name of operator changed) lepastu explain balik, and this new operator start refunding my money, took about 7 working days iirc.

Social media bring alot negativity. (Sesi meluahkan perasaan),"Many months ago i delete most my social media (FB,IG,X,TT, linkedin, and couples more) except Reddit and bookmark local newspaper website to less fomo, atleast for now.

I'm working on vfx studio, i used to follow up all things about my related industry for years but socmed being socmed, the algorithm, there's too much unnecessary drama, toxic comments, too many bad news, too many good news(pun sama boleh ganggu fokus), it build more my anxiety and i got panic attack couple times and major depression.

For example like tiktok ig, really changed our society skewed of misinformation, play false emotion, hatred all side/angles, mixing all that it's become harder to use for stuff.
Even i tried curated heavily. I used to share my artwork but now socmed more like a shitshow, socmed companies doesn't care the user as long people keep using it. 

I understand socmed can be good content and benefits, because it used to be good in early days, but the outcome is bad for people's minds in long term in my problem lah.
There's a things of see too many good things has the side effects as well.

Another reason why i delete is concern security and privacy about me and my family, people asking me like ""hey, u punya family ada buat_____ itu ini eh? Kenapa buat mcmtu je, nasihat je?"" It feel uncomfortable that i had to cover story others my family ""business"".
But if my kenalan share about me, yeah... That I can't do anything. 

The reason i post here because in this subreddit and bolehland slowly people share that and it's like asking flaming more drama in here as well, example like foodpanda and abg wira. Weird politics moment as well.

People might say to me, ""delete2 pun addicted main Reddit juga"". I addicted because i am already addicted to internet itself since 90s, so its irrelevant , what i meant is in general socmed are truly designed to be addictive of collectively toxic peoples. 

Ok im typing too much but i hope  doesn't affect future young generation... Even though i think too late but I'm still hopeful. 

Understand that i never mentioned to other people suruh delete socmed, but it can be moderation and be mindful.
It just not for me anymore.

Currently im mindful what to read and i spend more conversation with my family than before.

Anyways, Thanks for reading.

Extra note 1 : actually I am really very happy nowadays compared to many months ago. Not depressed anymore, above just want to do confession. Thanks for good response i got.","Something I heard from someone about ""getting bored is a lost art"" and I really agree.

I remember in my childhood when we didn't have internet, we get bored and read books, watch some TV, go cycling, and personally I learned how to use a camera which eventually became my hobby,

Now I don't mean that we should all go back and get bored and do nothing. But I think the possible mindset shift could be ""it's fine to do nothing"". And I mean nothing as in, not even scrolling social media.

There's too much information, drama and toxicity in social media and now I find it counter-productive (I used to use it to share my photography stuffs).

Anyway, I've been having a social media diet for about 2 months and it's working great for me. I'm actively seeking our to improve my hobbies and find the same hobby groups. || Great job on quitting social media. I have quit as well over a year ago and it's been amazingly peaceful. Better relationships with family and friends as well as you are not clouded with jealousy and just be real with people.

So many documentaries on the bad effects as well so it's not just in your head bro, it is damaging and I'm glad you're done with it too, enjoy it and never go back to it, after some time you will realise why did you even spend so much time and energy on it and caused your own self so much upset-ness for nothing.

You will need to do something else to fill in the time tho and also be patient while queuing or on public transport cos you will not be scrolling anymore. 

You will also enjoy better focus and actually creating more of your artwork without the pressure of having to keep showing you are doing something to others, it's all in your timeframe and goals and you will actually be so much more productive! || I only have Reddit & Whatsapps. Left Facebook & LinkedIn long time ago. Have more time to myself to real life things || My problem with social media in general is that you're force to know and care a lot of information at a time. That's not counting shit takes and useless dramas. That really exhaust your mind.

That's why I made a new twitter account, follows only my interests, shitposts and content creators that I only like. No celebs, no fan accounts, no politicians or influncers also not even my friends. || I agree, I think social media warps our perception of what’s real and common vs what only a small percentage of the population experience. 

Similarly, apps like Tiktok and Instagram make us believe so many people look like models and thus lower our self esteem a ton. 

I also hate how everything is an ad or marketing these days, I just wanna be able to enjoy life without being bombarded with products that are supposedly going to make my life better or something. No I’m not going to throw away all my money on some dumb course or beauty product, thanks.

I feel infinitely better after deleting all my social media, I keep reddit because it’s informative and not primarily a photo-sharing platform. Plus you can curate your feed based on the subreddits you follow, unlike other sites. 10/10 would recommend for better mental health. || I quit facebook, twitter, instagram. I keep reddit because it's more chill kinda and there is news published here as well. Any additional news my wife will tell me || To me, socmed is just like a virtual kopitiam. The pakciks of yore used to hangout in kopitiam in the mornings to catch up on latest news and give their hot takes to each other and go home for lunch after. 

Now, we're hanging out in the virtual kopitiam at every 15 min breaks in our lives, it's not only toxic, but it's overdose, even if the posts and comments we see are actually positive. 

I think limiting our socmed usage time to before work and before bedtime is the best. Just for catching up purposes and not let it dominate our real life. || Hang in there bro! I hope you find peace inshaAllah. 

Nothing wrong with having no social media accounts. Working in VFX with it's long hours and sometimes endless, repetitive tasks can also really affect your mood and whole outlook on life because of just how tired you get. The stress creeps up on you and wears you down, at least that's how it was for me a long time ago.

What worked for me was to find hobbies or activities that required no PC or any electronic gadgets as much as possible, just to break the cycle of constantly looking at screens all day long. This will make you focus more on the important stuff when you actually do go online and read, because you'll have less time for all the nonsense, which in turn should eventually make you feel less depressed and stressed out. || I uninstalled Instagram last week and already saw major improvements in my life. Picked up cross-stitching and cooking!

It just came to the point where I realised I don't need to know that A and B did X and Y. And I don't have to show my ""network"" that I did this and that. Things that I really wanted to share would be sent straight through WhatsApp, meaning that relationships with family and real friends really are gonna improve drastically. 

Glad you had this epiphany OP, it's time to live life. || Yep thanks for this.

Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect?,"Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me?","[https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

I would rather work part time for something else if i have the know how or network/social skills, because the uncertainty and how tiring the part time job is


If only my job would pay me better…

Typing this while at work, if grammar/language bad, is because i have to pause and do work, some big customer DR activity today, saturday also work cannot do grab car today… || I'm a Grab driver. I only drive at night, but my day job is very undemanding, hence I can drive long hours at night. The KPI I set myself is minimum 6 hours or RM 150 profit per night. I drive an Almera; full tank gives me about 450-500km on no-jam drives, but I simplify it by setting RM 30 per day for petrol. The target you set of 2000 per month is easily attainable IMHO. || As a university student, try to get a side hustle that complements what you’re majoring in e.g for a compsci student: building websites as a freelancer, or building an actual product that people would pay to use, or part time work in a software company.

As an aside, you can earn myr 5k or more monthly building software as a side hustle. Try browsing Upwork or any other freelancing or remote job boards.

There’s nothing wrong with working part time in a restaurant or driving grab per se, but there’s the opportunity cost of time that can be used to reinforce your learnings.

Your overarching goal should be to learn and to prepare yourself for your eventual career. The money will come later. || There's one post recently from 1 grab driver (KL area iirc) asking bout some opinion. If I'm not mistaken from his post,  your payrate is still the same regardless if it's rush hour or chill hour. If it's not in this subreddit, probably in r/bolehland. Good luck searching. || Grab take some % too from the fee. As general rule maybe say you get 50% from the fee. Considering petrol, maintenance etc. Maybe grab drivers can advise better. || I don't think you can. Not because of your age, but because Grab doesn't allow part-timers any longer. 

They changed their policies around 4 years ago. Before that, you could be a part time Grab driver as long as you're  21 and above.

Edit:
Sorry, you can be a Grab driver. I was misinformed. || Don't waste your time || work part time for event job || Agree with your advice. If I’m hiring, I’d rather pick someone with sales experience over driving a car around.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive.

[Female employee was hit for no reason]


A very serious incident happened in our store! The
delivery riders from Foodpanda threw things at our staff!


Here's what happened: we had an order waiting for 30
minutes, but the Foodpanda rider assigned to it had not arrived yet. So we notified the system, and they
arranged for a new rider to deliver the order.
After 45 minutes, the original rider arrived with another
friend. He argued with our staff because he was
unhappy that he was replaced. He then threw the
beverages at our female employee, who was scared
and started crying.


I told them that this behavior was inappropriate and that
we should calm down and talk it out. After some
arguments, the rider again threw the menu at me and
challenged us to call the police. He claimed that his
house was just behind our store. We were stunned and
mad at their attitude and behavior!
We want to clarify that we are not authorized to replace
delivery riders. We were just worried about keeping our
customers waiting and then filing a complaint in the
system. As it does not show that our store has
completed preparing the order.


On the day of the incident, we reported it to the police.
Unfortunately, they said no one was injured, and nothing
was damaged in the store. Therefore, they could not
take any action and only filed a report. No police officer
has contacted us to follow up on the situation!
We feel bad about this. Can't we seek justice for our
female employees against this kind of thuggish
behavior?
We have always taught our employees to treat people
with courtesy, whether they are customers or delivery
riders. Our employees must express gratitude when
delivering food.


We also understand and appreciate the riders' efforts in
delivering our food rain or shine. We even offer all-day
discounts to all delivery riders to show our appreciation.
We also want to emphasize that we have encountered
kind and responsible delivery riders. Rude delivery
riders are just a minority.
Lastly, we hope the delivery rider who caused the
incident can be punished accordingly and apologize to
our female employee. They should also guarantee that
they will not repeat this offense against anyone else!


Although we have reported this to FoodPanda, one of
the delivery riders is still delivering food, and it is
possible that he is using someone else's identity to
continue doing so! We hope that all businesses can be
more vigilant! || Police can’t take action? What the fuck? Really || the bigger bullshit is that our police cannot take action because no one was injured....

so if i throw shit at a balai is ok? coz no one is injured and nothing was damaged right?

Need help for money management for fresh grad!,"Hello students and fresh grad. Just want to know what is your average daily spending and cost of living in shah alam, selangor? I just finished my internship and working as Junior IT consultant (contract for 2 months, gonna rest after finish and find other jobs in data scientist related field after raya) with Rm2k salary (yea i know quite low but the workload is not that much huhu), tolak epf and socso got around Rm 1.8k. My average spending for food per day is around Rm 18 per day. Kadang rasa cam banyak 😅, kadang rasa normal. Makanan always tapau je, kalau weekdays biasa spend kat breakfast Rm 3-5, dinner Rm8-10. Weekends Rm 15-20 for 2/3 meals (i use foodpanda). But kalau member ajak lepak, kadang boleh cecah Rm 20-30 but that's an outliers.

Komitmen lain:

-Petrol: Rm 5-6 per week, Rm 20-24 per month (rumah sewa 2.5km dgn tempat kerja)

-House rent: Rm 210 (utilities included)

-Phone prepaid: Rm 20

-Toiletries: Rm 100 (sabun, toothfloss, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, etc)

-Entertainment: Rm14 per month (tgk wayang kalau ada movie mantap)

-Laundry: Rm 4 per week, Rm 16 per month (dobiqueen) 

1) should i cut something? 
2) how much should i save per month? 
3) should i buy raw stuff/ingredients and cook at home? how much can i save if i do so😅.

p/s: im happy the way im living right now, no pressure, but feel like fancy and boros sometimes because of my food spending. and i really miss the time when living with my parent, my mum's cooking, it's good and it's FREEEE🥲.

Thank you in advance!","Might be worthwhile reposting this in r/malaysianpf || You spend a lot on food and toiletries, please consider cutting down || Rm18 for 2 meals a day, in kl is considered really cheap. So don’t beat yourself up about that. If anything, spend rm2-5 more to get some fruits into your system. 

If the rental house allows u to cook, and if it has some pots n pans, you can learn to cook some simple pasta. 

Pesto Penne is easiest. Boil the pasta for about 7-8 mins, drain then mix in 2 spoons of bottled pesto. You’re set. Pasta is about rm7 a box. Pesto sauce I think is rm20. Can get about 8 servings out of the pesto sauce bottle, with lots of pasta left in the box for next round. 

Other than that, don’t think u can cut out much else unless u become social outcast and just stay at home (not recommended). You’re on your first steps of adulthood, so current earnings aren’t exactly going to help you.

Rm100 for toiletries, seems a bit much haha. I don’t use cologne so maybe mine is cheaper. || You don't eat lunch? || Well nothing much to cut down from your monthly budget except food expense. You also have justified your spending on the toiletries. Im surprised you only spend RM 20 for your phone prepaid. 

From my own experience, cooking homecook meal can be really hassle especially if you cook Malay dishes (need alot of aromatic ingredients & spices).  Then after that you need to clean up the kitchen space. Not really worth it if you cook in small batches. During my early years of working & living away from my parent, i had done this to reduce my food expenses.

I do cook at home but it really 'basic', more of 'slicing & assemble' the food. The only more 'complex' things i do was cooking rice using a rice cooker & boiling eggs using electric multi cooker.

I will boil the eggs in large batches (4-6 pcs) at a times & keep it in the fridge. My diet was basically fruit, vegetables that can be eaten raw (cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes etc), boiled egg, bread (sandwich), rice & oat.

In the morning i usually eat oat with fruit or egg mayo sandwich as breakfast. Both was really easy to make. For oat meal i just need to add hot water &  diced fruit on top of it. Then for the sandwich, i mash the hard boiled egg & mix it with mayo. Slicing some vege & assemble both of it with bread as sandwich. 

During weekend i cook a rice & eat it with boiled egg & raw vege as Ulam with sambal tumbuk for lunch. Sometimes i will buy lauk (chicken, meat or fish) from the restaurant with kuah kosong. Then i cook rice at home & sliced the vege for Ulam. Oh i forget to mention, i usually buy 50sen of ice cube from local grocery store almost everyday & make large batch of sweet ice lime tea (teh O ais limau) that last me for a whole day. Maybe the sweet ice lime tea that keep me going because i usually eat a lite lunch or sometimes skip the lunch.

But the most saving came from free 'dinner'. I usually go to local masjid for maghrib & isyak prayer. People usually donated food especially for majlis tahlil & during malam jumaat (bacaan yasin). If there no donated food for the day, i will eat oat with diced fruit for quick dinner. Actually going to masjid also help you built relationship with local community. Those masjid congregation was really a decent people. They will sincerely help you if you got any trouble. Having a support group like that while staying far away from your parent & families was really a bless.

My diet might be boring but i manage to survive on that. Definitely not for everyone to follow because not everybody can eat almost the same basic food everyday. Hope the best for you as now the food price not as cheap as before. Even egg price was damn expensive now. || Learn to cook || Masak at home can be mahal or murah depending on what sort of food you cook. If you can eat the same thing a few days in a row then you can save quite a bit. Like i usually meal prep for 5 days terus but im the type tak kisah makan the same thing repeatedly. But if you like your variety then having to cook different lauk everyday for one person portion macam not so jimat. || Alright will do! Thank youu || The toiletries part is the max i prepared for it, like premium pocket tissues, yg tebal and quite pricy (because of my sinus, tisu biasa takleh nanti makin gatal hidung hahaha), antacids stock (gastric), deodorant (buy in bulk ofcourse), pimple patch and things i mentioned above. || Yeah might spend a lil bit more for fruits.

Yeah they let me cook, i'll try doing the pasta recipe.

FoodPanda Malaysia has gotten to a new low. Where got free delivery?,,"With panda pro you get free delivery with any order RM25 and above. If you dont have panda pro, KFC probably gives free delivery on its own. Usually the restaurant would have a pink message up top stating how much you need to pay before you can get a free delivery (its usually 25 or 30 ringgit). Make sure to update your app to ensure the message appears

Btw do note the free delivery ONLY applies to delivery fees, restaurant can still charge extra fees. || It's a bait tag, they state free delivery on alot of shops but u need Panda Pro to actually use it. And the shit thing is, even with Panda Pro there is still minimum spend in order to get free delivery. || I think the bigger news for me is that KFC has become as expensive as Nando's quarter chicken set used to be, 6 years back.

And KFC has become utter shit, last I checked back in late 2018. || Delivery fees aside, the note about ""same as in store price"" is scummy. Most of the time the base price are jacked up along with hidden charges such as packaging.

Can we have this reported to consumer body? || Grab is doing thr same shit right now || It's misspelled, it's supposed to say Fee Delivery :) || Gotta pump up those numbers, usually it’s rm25 minimum to get free del.

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Which E Wallet best?,"Grabpay used to be my go to e wallet. However with the reduction in point system, I'm wondering which of the e wallets (Grabpay, Boost, Touch n go, MAE) provides the best returns in terms of usage? Both grab provides points which can use to exchange vouchers. Rarely use Boost now with their lousy star system, only using it for foodpanda as its the only one supported. Touch n go apparently allows you to have some chance at winning some items or some cashbacks with a spending of rm20 but only up to 10 times monthly.","Boost used to be fun with all those shake rewards that awarded cashbacks, but inevitably they had to do away with that as it was unsustainable.

Nowadays I use TnG more often because it has wider acceptance. || TnG eWallet honestly, and this is someone who was formerly a Boost ""regular user"" back in 2018, and someone who doesn't like the business practices of TnG and the toll concessionary fiasco

With the introduction of the TnG NFC Card (took them ages to even come out with that idea idk why) it's easier to just do daily commerce with touch n go ewallet nowadays, and using the funds to top up the card for my daily commute (komuter/MRT and tolls)

It used to be looking out for cashbacks and good deals but in the long run I'm looking for a ""wider acceptance"" and convenience; and TnG eWallet has a inherent advantage of the touch n go system existed for years || ShopeePay. They still provide you cashback (either coins or e-wallet) sometimes and allow withdrawals. || I pay with GrabPay if possible because of the points. Second choice is ShopeePay for coins. Other e-wallets have no benefits in my opinion. || I use ewallet very extensively and I don't like the idea of putting the numbers of my real cards online and storing them inside apps, plus, it's kinda divided as to which is the most popular ewallet currently. Some people or vendor might accept TnG while others might not. 

So, for normal expenditure, I used BigPay as a buffer of sorts. I will maintain a few hundred in BigPay (top up using internet bank transfer every week and minimizing the storing of any credentials inside my devices) and store its virtual card numbers in the apps of my other ewallets - ShopeePay/Grab/TnG.

So if a certain vendor only accepts one of the above-mentioned ewallets, I can easily flash top up on the go (topping up using BigPay's virtual Visa card) and pay using whichever ewallets I want to. 

That way, I don't have to bear with the concern that people or hackers could reach my real credit/debit cards so easily || TnG ewallet. Then you can get an RFID card and use it as a tng card that's connected to your ewallet. U don't need to open the app just use the card. || grab is my favorite || ShopeePay, lots of coins for both online and offline shopping || Grab and Shopee for me now. Only accepts my AMEX card which is my main point accumulating card. || they all suck and are insecure. That said i use TnG because its a bit like a 1% returns yearly savings account that you can use like normal and that you need it for tolls, but they regularly return more than that.

&#x200B;

The point system is of grab worse and grab is predatory by showing you gifts rather than just giving you a good deal instead.

Still if i dont need to use e-wallets i dont even bother, i just use card or cash where possible. These e-wallets are so insecure and badly made.",16/7/2022,32,19,1657955928,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/w0asyd/which_e_wallet_best/

CMV: 2022 Bazar Ramadan is not worth it,"I went to the bazaar in Kampung Baru and a few other places in KL. It was too crowded which increased the risk of getting Covid.

Uncultured Grabfood & Foodpanda riders.,"Some of y'all really need to be restricted from any forms of access to a motorcycle. You got lives at home to feed but what about other lives on the road be it car drivers/pedestrians? 

Since March 2020, some of y'all been:

1. Breaching red traffic lights and when honked, there you go flashing that middle finger of yours or looking at me as if its perfectly normal.

2. Riding at least 80km/h over zebra crossings at schools with students around. School freakin students. Are you that of a degenerate? Schools reopened, yall dont own the road like you used to. 


It doesn't just happen in only 1 particular state. The nature of my work require constant travel and I'm sick of the risk that I have to anticipate on a weekly basis.","I have a Chinese friend who looks Malay with an English name common to Both races. Whoever he orders non-halal food, without even asking for clarification, he’s had riders preach and scold him for being unfaithful bla bla.

After coming back from a round-the-Peninsular 2,500km bike trip, I've reached a similar conclusion that I did from travelling in other countries: people are just nastier in bigger cities.

Road manners were so much better in the countryside and the people I managed to converse with were much friendlier and kinder. Living in close proximity with lots of people stresses the animal side of our brains, I guess. || You forgotten the rempit menace turned into employed riders. I for one am happy these guys are now working rather than taking drugs || It's amazing to see how people giving bullshit reason to justified these reckless riders. Hey, you have job to do doesn't mean you can just endagering others.

I wonder will you say the same thing if one day it was one of yours family member got hit by these reckless riders. || These dudes really need to be more careful. Many times in my own residential area they’ll shoot out at junctions without looking at the main road. I’m not even going fast, maybe 20-30 km, and they can still nearly hit me. Then they have the gall to flip me off too. 

Half the time I see them looking at their phones. I mean c’mon la, I know you need to work, but do so safely. Check your phone at the side of the road and when you’re stationary. If you get hurt after you hit me, I’m the one in the wrong as usual too. || This literally happened to me yesterday, Grab Rider with passenger sped through a red light as I was slowly lurching forward, If I moved any faster for sure collide || One time I ordered from FP, like my house is 40-45min from the town so I don’t mind getting it even if it passed an hour.

If i order take away, its only from restaurants that have their own like mcdonalds.

foodpanda/grab add at least rm 10 on top of what you order for example. If just 1 guy order, thats crazy expensive.

The drivers drive like crazy. Whether i drive or walk, they are a menace. They park blocking cars even when theres a large pavement or motorcycle dedicated spots with space right next by.

They drive on large pavements, often almost hitting me many times when i walk.

ANd ofcourse when they beat red lights and get hit, it causes delays for everyone else, and they dont even have to pay for the damage they cause.

They will drive the wrong side of the road even on narrow one way roads, or even highways. A few times i've had to dodge an incoming biker on an exit going the wrong way even when there is an exit path leading the direction that the biker wants very easily.

They can run over people and still not have to pay anything (malaysian law favours motorcyclists). If you dont want mat rempits in the first place, both the law and police are needed, but police dont even care if bikers drive like mad, as they themselves dont even drive properly.

A Rant About The Panda of Food.,"I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

[Here's a screenshot for half the conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/279456085885321216/927448327304400966/InkedILLITERATE_LI.jpg). I feel right stupid having this much patience.

I literally got this same email more than 7 times now. It's all the same copy pasted garble cock but from differently named bots. This is beyond infuriating for something so stupidly simple.

Do people still use Panda Mart still...? Or do you guys just use FoodPanda for... well, food?

I know I risk this post not being worthy or relevant to Malaysia or r/Malaysia but holy shit did I need an outlet. I am sorry.","About a month ago I tried FoodPanda. Came 2.5hrs later. No way of cancelling cos the whole app couldn’t even load the Help Centre. The food arrived with a receipt saying to prep food by when, so I know it had sat for an hour and a half. In between, estimated time kept changing and a rider was assigned 1hr before it was delivered. Rider went around the world but not collect my food. When I ask the rider, he said he immediately went to the store to pickup when receiving the request. 

Deleted it after that. Ordered in my office so my colleagues knew. And just recently, one colleague experienced status being delivered but food didn’t arrive. Went thru a few rounds of Helpdesk to finally get a refund. She sighed and said should have deleted it when it happened to me. 

I don’t usually like to outright say boycott something, but Panda is definitely something never to use unless ur life depends on it. || I've given up on using foodpanda. I've only ever used their service twice and both times they made me wait an hour for my delivery before canceling.

""Hi Customer, it's too bad but what made sure to wait till 9pm to tell you that we will not be taking you order. Good Luck and try not to starve.""

fucking dogshit indie company Rito games. Sorry, force of habit. || last time i remember, some foodpanda guy put a food in front of my house, i checked it and it's not ours. no one order foodpanda. and i put it there (outside because my sister say so) until 8 pm when my parent is back home. ask my parent who is this food for? they also dont know. at least tomorrow the person who order it get what they want. damn || nowadays, i only use FP to view the restaurant menu.

![gif](giphy|bC9czlgCMtw4cj8RgH|downsized) || I have made it my new years resolution to quit using any e hailing services like Grab, and Foodpanda. Especially for getting food.

The amount i spent on Grab alone is ridiculous. || I can't speak for PandaMart (I don't really dare try this tbh) but the last few times I tried Foodpanda (which was some time ago - because I've stopped) yielded pretty poor experiences. In some cases it's stuff like wrong orders which may be the restaurant's fault (but it doesn't explain why I'm getting these issues way more often with Foodpanda than other services), but in some cases they just don't refund wrong/missing orders despite following through with all their processes. || I had bad experience with food panda also. Especially address part where it keep autocorrect even if I manually input my address. This cause driver to deliver to wrong place and problem cause etc. After that, I no longer use it coz of the address issues and discontinues after using grab food || My gf insists on using FoodPanda when she orders and it's always bad. The time estimates don't make sense, you never know where dlthe driver is and things generally take forever. 

I use Grab and it's usually good, and if something (rarely) goes wrong I get vouchers. || I guess they were only really useful during the *Panda*-mic.

*gets booed offstage* || Yes, they are quite bad. with foodpanda and these delivery apps I started to only use cash as my payment method. If my order is wrong or it doesn't arrive but marked as arrived, i just don't pay and don't need to worry about my money or go through the brain rot of a customer service.

Also, for ordering food, a good tip is to look up these restaurant on google, some of them have their own delivery system that is cheaper or you can contact them and get it delivered through lalamove (I do this for orders from arabic restaurants mostly).",3/1/2022,151,77,1641191397,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/ruv3t7/a_rant_about_the_panda_of_food/
Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions,"hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please! 

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions","1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US)

But they have not been updating hazards recently like the recent floods...

Unfortunately there is not a single better alternative app at the moment. But you can try Google Maps.

You should look into where the closest clinics and hospitals are, in case anything happens. || Can only guess you're in Taylor's, Monash or Sunway U. Therefore:

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

You might find the night life there pleasing. || It's not difficult to go out and explore your surroundings on your own. That is how to learn more about any country you're in and the people.  

Don't expect everyone to spoon feed you information.  

Like another person mentioned, another way is to ask your other international classmates. || 1) speedmart, mydin as your initial ones, then check other big and small. For instance each have their advantage and disadvantage comparing big and small stores. For instance i found that the cheapest sliced cheese cost less at a local shop than bake with yen.  
2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat. I kept it simple, inexpensive and healthy so this saved time. || Dont eat seafood at local mamak tho, the price enter another realm aka kayangan. || You make it seem like we don't live in pandemic times...",22/12/2021,19,24,1640173200,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/rm3heg/im_a_new_student_in_malaysia_and_i_have_some/

Tipping culture in Malaysia. Share your story/experience :D,"I know tipping is not a huge culture here in Malaysia. But have any of you tipped before? And what's your experience like?

For me, I rarely tip, but I do when I feel like that person deserves it. Imo, the service industry in Msia is tough, earning low wages and having to keep up with demanding and sometimes rude customers.

So whenever I see a waiter who gets out of their way to make my experience great, or even that Foodpanda rider who went through bad weather to deliver my food with a smile. I usually tip em.

It always make me happy to see their surprised face when getting tipped, I want them to know that they did an outstanding job and I hope that this small tip would make their day.

Now, onto your story! 

*I usually tip between RM 2 - 10.","Tipping when you find the person has an excellence service is ok but god forbid,don't ever adopt usa's stupid tipping culture when you HAVE to tip no matter what. Hell, if your party has 6 or more, the tip is automatically 30%! || I have tipped drivers/ waiters/ grass cutters/ car washers/ etc.. not usually, but when i feel they deserve it for charging too low. || I tip grabfood/foodpanda riders if they delivered in rain, or if its a Muslim rider delivering non-halal food coz I appreciate that not all would do so. Not much la rm2-5 only.

Slightly off topic, but I think we can and should treat workers/cleaners/guards well. At the very minimum, I think you should be courteous to them. One thing I've learnt from the Harry Potter books is that it's not how you treat your peers and your superiors, but how you treat those 'inferior' to you that really says a lot about you. So.... To bring it back to the topic, I think tipping often doesn't take much but it can go a long way for someone, and hopefully make their day. || [deleted] || once I worked as a waiter on second day of CNY during my semester break, a couple tipped me RM50 for working during CNY (even though I actually couldn’t take off lol) . Made my entire week || I normally tip Grab food riders. As someone who orders fairly frequently from Grab, their drivers are courteous (apologize for being late or or a simple but pleasant ""Have a nice day!/Enjoy your food!""). I usually tip RM2 or RM3 ( I give cash), but there was one time when it was raining cats and dogs, and the poor rider was completely drenched and still apologized profusely for being 10 minutes late. I felt so sorry for him that I gave him RM10. Definitely worth it though.

I disagree though with the western culture that tipping is essential. While I understand they don’t get paid a living wage and rely heavily on tips to go by, providing service and expecting a tip brings about potentially many unwelcomed incidents. || I do a lot, not sure if it’s considered tipping, but when I went to buy at stalls or pasar malam, I always ask them to keep the change if it’s less than RM1.

And, isn't that what Grab and Food Panda drivers)riders are? They're freelancers, no? || Because it falls into the same business model.

You're providing a service of delivery (think McDelivery) at the same time you are outsourcing all of the cost associated with the service to your ""employees"".

The ""pay"" only looks good when you take into account that you are not getting anything into your EPF or any other benefits, and you are expected to bear the cost of everything yourself. Like I said in my analogy of a tech company, the data plan, mobile phone, vehicle, and fuel cost are all expected to be borne by yourself.

If your bike needs servicing, tayar pamcit because you ran over a pothole, oh and you get injured because of that? In a ""normal"" company, you'd be compensated in some ways, either fully or partially. In the ""privilege"" of working with these companies? Haha your problem la, doctor bill? your problem la. Income? your problem la, where got medical leave? Repair bill for your vehicle? Your bike, your problem la. Your phone fell on the road and broke? Your problem la.

See the problem here?

Even in some of the lower end chinaman company, people have the bare minimum shit like a company phone or some sort or bare minimum compensation to make sure the employees doesn't bear every cost and hazards of the job themselves.

That's why I'll never see them as anything ""good"" aside from normalizing a trend of outsourcing the cost of operation to the employees to maximize margin.

We used to complain that the company ask if we have our own car and is comfortable travelling, complain that the compensation is tak cukup for the work (ie travel petrol cost RM 50 but claim only maximum RM 20).

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

MrBeast Burger in Malaysia,"I'm sure you'll be familiar with this business especially if you watch MrBeast's videos. This business has been introduced and had grown in both the USA and the UK. It all started with this [video](https://youtu.be/dg2Ag3e8W-Q) from the biggest, most famous YouTuber named MrBeast. I feel it will be a good idea to introduce MrBeast Burger in Malaysia as it can help struggling restaurants which had increased a lot since lockdown, through letting them sell burgers that are connected to the MrBeast brand, and allowing customers to eat at their own restaurants where they made the burgers or delivering them to homes through Grab or Foodpanda. What do you think about this, and should MrBeast Burger be launched in Malaysia with their ""ghost kitchen"" concept (which can help out other struggling restaurants during this pandemic)?

"How much do delivery riders earn, on average?","Hey monyets, I'm an intern, rn. Least I can say is, the corporate market is looking a hell of a lot worse since COVID started.

Anyway, I'm opting to start out as a Foodpanda Rider after I graduate. The thing is tho, I'm curious of the statistics. I have enough savings to get a bike, and since food delivery is gonna be going around for a while, I'm planning of doing it too 

So.. how much on average, do grabfood, foodpanda, or any delivery riders earn if it was in a city? 

How many months can I expect to pay off the bike I bought? The ones under 150cc, etc...

Is it a worth it job to get some extra cash after graduation? To pass the time, even?

Just wanna get some insight from the delivery riders out there. Thanks!","hi bro, im a food panda rider. But just part time since im still doing my degree. So in a week i work for just about 3 days and usually around 5 hours per day. sometimes less than that. I can made around rm600 per month. So if u do full time, im sure u can reach 2K || As part-time ok else it will cost more to you in long term. The biggest drawback is you don't learn anything from the delivery gig job. || It's probably not worth it if you factor in depreciation, time and petrol. You are better off using the time to make yourself marketable to employers. || I see, bro. Thanks for the insight, 600/month as spare change is not bad, tbh. || Yeah true, its just the same thing day after day, I guess u can be pretty bored after a while. || Yea, breaking even is gonna be hard, if u factor those in. Just hope employers are still looking for people to work for them in this economy. || Lets not forget that when the economy reopens employers will be seeking to rehire those they let off previously (maybe not the same individuals, but similar situations), so you'll be competing with veterans regardless. But depending on industry I think its still pretty good odds to get a job so long as you dont set your asking salary too high, since employers will be dealing with tight budgets then. 

&#x200B;

Honestly tho, I dont really think its such a big thing to consider depreciation. If you're using that bike only for delivery, then sure its something to think about. But if that bike is also gonna be your transportation for other stuff, then you basically dont have to pay money for a car or public transport anymore. Petrol wise.... I dont think its an issue either, since motorbikes arent subject to traffic jams the way cars are, so long as you're being efficient with your fuel (refrain from unnecessary accelerating and braking). Time on the other hand... if you already have a job, then sure.. focus on that. If you're unemployed I'm pretty sure you dont spend 17 hours a day surfing jobstreet and looking for a job. Surely spending 3-5 flexible hours a day earning side income doing deliveries is possible. My neighbor is retired and he's doing Grab deliveries with a car for a few hours a day, and he tells me the income is enough to cover the car's loan and give him some pocket money to spend. The other dude is doing this while still being a student, so I'm sure you can manage (assuming of course you dont have a job right now) doing both delivery job and making yourself marketable for employers.",27/5/2021,9,7,1622134883,malaysia,foodpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/nmc1in/how_much_do_delivery_riders_earn_on_average/

How to get unlimited voucher discount on Foodpanda,"**Late late update:**

This bug no longer works. Foodpanda team patched it on February.

If you still need to save on discounts, **just buy an Foodpanda account from shopee sellers.**

It costs around **RM 0.55 - RM 1.00** per account. When you got the account, just use **PANDABARU** promo to get discounts.

The promo code gives you a **40% off** on your order but with a **max cap of RM 10**.

Also! Remember to follow the instructions from the sellers. They usually wrote about it in the description section. 

Btw, you can see active promo codes and their details on the official Foodpanda website. 

[Link Here.](https://www.foodpanda.my/contents/deals)

You must have came across numerous Foodpanda account listings on Shopee, Lazada and others.

Some sellers price their services high, but there're still some who sell at a low price.

**But why pay, when you can do it yourself?**

**Note: I contacted the Foodpanda technical team long time ago regarding this \[Invite Friends\] bug. But they straight ignored my message and emails. Perhaps they have earned enough money already by** **~~scamming~~** **refunds?**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Basically, this bug is like inviting yourself to the system. Getting both welcome and referral reward vouchers altogether.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**What kinds of vouchers will this net you?**

**You'll get two vouchers:**

* **First-order: RM 10 discount off ( Min. spend RM 20 excl. delivery and service fees )**
* **Second-order: RM 10 discount off ( same requirement as the first voucher )**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Steps on how to get infinite discount:**

1. **If you have registered a Foodpanda account previously with your phone number written. You must log in to the account and change the phone number.**
   1. Just change it to random phone number like 016-999-999
2. Create a new account on Foodpanda
3. After you have reached the page where it asks for your phone number. Just click  ❌ on the top-right of your screen.
4. Then the account will be successfully created without a phone number.
5. Now. Click \[ Invite Friends \] from the options panel.
6. Tap your referral link once to copy the link automatically.
7. Go to your phone's browser and paste the referral link.
8. **In this step, your browser should redirect you to the Foodpanda app automatically**
9. **Try other browsers if you have an issue with automatic redirection.**
10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**
* **The voucher expiry date is 1 month from the claim date.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Bug no longer works \] | They patched it on Feb**

* **See more details on the top of this post.**","Your ""Please don't scam your local businesses!"" warning post sure sounds like an instruction manual.

Regardless - please don't scam your local food shops. They bore the brunt of low business during lockdown. || [deleted] || Update: I think I should have clarified something before posting.

I don't encourage anyone to abuse this bug. 

The reason I post this information to the Reddit is that I want it to become viral so that Foodpanda will finally take action to fix and stop this bug.

I have already contacted Foodpanda before, but I guess no one will take note of anything coming from the mouth of a beginner programmer.

My voice is literally too little, that's why I need everyone's help to make Foodpanda fix the bug.

A lot of Shopee sellers already earned RM 1000 or even more from selling accounts with this bug. 

I cannot just sit there and do nothing. That's why I decided to post on the Malaysia subreddit.

I'm sorry that I didn't state my purposes clear at the beginning. I just want to stop this damn thing and prevent any more innocent buyers to pay RM 7+ for a Foodpanda account. || Gameshark ke ni? || Dont work anymore || Thanks for the detailed tutorial || Reminds the trick to get free dinner plate back then for a month || The secret ingredient is crime. || I'm not sure thought...

I have told Foodpanda team about this bug. I even gave an array of solutions to fix this bug.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

…………………………………………………………..

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

Jutaan terima kasih kepada:

o Suami saya (Ekhwan Fahmy), keluarga saya, keluarga suami saya. Lebiuuuuuu….

o Kawan2 yang memberikan sokongan moral

o Wakil2 dari syarikat saya bekerja yang selalu bertanya khabar, setiap hari

How to differentiate police in malaysia?,"Hi guys, i just want to share a bit harsh experience i have gotten in my life in Malaysia.

I am an expat living here for about 7 years this year. 

Last week i was going down from my condo to lobby to take my order from foodpanda with my gf around 9pm.

Suddenly there is one random guy admit himself as police shout at me “only one person each house can go out during RMO”. At first i did not notice he is police, because he is not in his uniform and then i said “yeah i aware of the rules, and we are not going anywhere as we are about to take the food only”. He keep scolding me with high tone for not following the RMO rules. 

He started asking for my house number, my IC, etc. I did not bring my IC since i thought i just went to lobby and settle everything. He keep prolonging the session until people are watching at us and create crowd audience there.

I seek for help from the security of my condo, sadly they cowardly doing nothing as they seems afraid to take action toward this guy who admit himself as a police. His defence was “giving me advice”. Then i said “i took ur advice, thanks. Wht else u want?”

Since the condition was not conducive anymore and he kept yelling at me and strike chest-to-chest on me. I started to thinking that it might go to “money” solution thingy.

I started losing my patience, and i said to him “who is not following the safety procedure now? Where is ur face mask? U dont follow physical distance rule (for striking chest2chest) , u create crowd and u see nobody wearing face mask here, isnt it increasing the chance of people here getting infected. Where is ur letter of duty?”

Then only he lost words and said “u get lost” 

I just wondering am i doing the right way?
Any tips for me for how to differentiate real police and the fake one (like a money oriented one)?","Malaysian police must wear police uniform while on roadblocks or MCO duty. As a civilian, you have the right to ask for his/her police ID. You even have the right to take a photo of the police ID for future reference if you're not certain that the person you're talking to is a police or not. || Real police carry their ID card at all times, even when not in uniform. You have the right to ask them to show it. [Here's a great article about what to do if confronted by a plainclothes police.](https://asklegal.my/p/how-to-identify-malaysian-plainclothes-police) || From your story I don’t think that guy is a policeman. A real police won’t bother to ask your house unit number. My apartment area always has a roadblock even before MCO. No policeman that stopped me bother to ask my house unit number. 

Best case scenario; that guy just scares people by pretending he’s a police. Worst case scenario; he’s a scammer or potential robber. ID card still can be forged. 

God forbid any bad thing ever happen to you but I always pray for your safety. 

Next time when you go to the lobby to take food, bring your phone along and record anyone that stop you saying they are police. Be calm and clearly record his face and snap picture of his ID if he shows one. Asked him nicely to show his ID and tell him you maybe double check his ID at police station. Most importantly just be polite answering his questions. He may use your word against you if he’s a real deal. So better safe than sorry. 

A real policeman won’t easily get angry or bother to be recorded. They know they’re legit if police station run his face id in police record. To him, he don’t lose anything because he’s just doing his job. But if the guy is an imposter, he should run. 

If you feel the guy is an imposter, all you do once finished recording, go to police station, tell the officer that someone approached you telling you that he’s a policeman. Then the officer will asked you to write official police report so that the investigation can be proceed. Then later give them copy of the video you recorded and then let police do their job. 

I know it’s easy to get panic if being approach by enforcer. Just be calm and answer them calmly. Malaysian’s enforcer is always being trained to be nice to civilians no matter how shitty the civilian’s attitude are. Their rule is simple: if you showing attitude to them, then you must be doing something wrong. || If they claim to be a police officer but are not in uniform, you can ask them to show you their police card which they should always have on them || Wait, you are an ‘expat’ but you have IC? || Why is a policeman at a condo lobby? You're at Menara City One? || Maa PunDek.. apa Security Guard buat?. 
Definately imposter.. 

1) Contact yr apartment Management, email them ,let they know whats going on. The Security Guard are suppose to vetting n help you. 

2) Depending on the response of yr Building Management, if lukewarm.. just call the Police Station informing them. Or You can ask a local to do that for you. (I strongly believe you should, as police can only act if theres information ). 

3) yr action will definitely help deter, that crook. || Just cough on him next time. || If they claim they are police and they are not showing their badge or any identification.

Is better for you to just walk away, if he is some kind of thug you are just getting yourself into trouble.

If he is a police, and he is maybe very tired or sick of his duty then maybe you will get yourself into a bigger trouble.

He was not wrong anyway, is MCO now, and you are going out with a party of 2 rather than just one.

If you are alone, and you have a good reason to go out, and the police come in a group with proper identification, I would agree you to confront.

But rule is a rule, just obey it and once you violated the law, you will just get yourself into trouble during this ""critical"" time.

Joggin and awlking alone was nott wrong, but once doctor got fine 10k for jogging outside , or maybe because he was being arrogant and tried to lecture the policemen. || Please ensure that your submission is inline with the [COVID-19/MCO direct submission guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/wiki/covid19subm) to prevent it from being deleted from the subreddit.

This is a plea to all Malaysians.," To all the companies out there, the big CEOs, COOs, CTOs, board members, and bosses. Please, prioritise your employee's health and safety. 

Please, please, love your call centre staff, and all your front liners. If it's at all possible for your employees to work from home, even at a reduced efficiency, PLEASE LET THEM. 

The country NEEDS as many people as possible to stay home and stay safe. Your employees are scared and compromised every day they have to leave their homes. What if they get sick, what if they get caught by the police, what if the area they're in doesn't have food, what if the building they're in isn't as clean as it should be, what if they get sick, go home, and spread it to their parents or children. 

The medical infrastructure needs people to stay home, stay safe. Don't risk the spread, don't overwhelm our medical facilities. The more people are sick at the same time, the more people aren't going to be able to get the treatment they need, and that means a higher rate of death.

I get it though, while you sit at home now, your big worry now is how the company is going to survive financially and be able to continue providing for all employees in the future. That's why I say, if it's possible for them to work from home even at a reduced rate, let them.

Please, this is also not the time to worry about what the stupid customers who care about no one but themselves will say, this is the time to prove yourself as a leader of a business, and place your employees health and safety at the top of your priority list. 

&#x200B;

To all of us working from home, in comfort and safety. Please, give the brands and businesses a break. Don't bash them online for slower service, or long waiting times. Please understand the position everyone is in right now. Please don't be that person yelling at a service agent because you had to wait 45 minutes on a call. Don't be the person complaining at your slow internet because you can't watch Netflix. Don't be the person scolding Grabfood or Foodpanda for not giving good enough deals and/or fast deliveries.

They know most of us who work minimum wage are scared of losing our pay and so many people are willing to fill in the vacancies. || My company is registered under essential services. We work in the safety industry for maritime and oil&gas.

We decided to reduce our workforce by half each employee taking every other day off to reduce contact. Masks and hand sanitizers are offered for free. Any MC taken during this period will not be recorded.

Still our employee hates us, we cannot afford to close because there are vessels and platform depending on us. Our competitors are at full force, and we r forced to sub jobs to them because we r running with a skeleton crew.

The emails oh god, we just cannot even keep up. Every worker is wanting us to close while on the other hand every client is begging for us to remain operational.

We've gotten official letters that we r allowed to remain open. Our workers don't want to work. Our clients cannot afford for us to shut down.

A few employee even went as far as reported us to the police. They came and took a look around, green light us to remain open.

My company is under essential category, so the company worked with full force even with MCO announced. until 2 days later the govener email asking every CEOs to take the MCO seriously, some of the competitor went partial shutdown. Yet my company only allow a few of us work from home. Others BAU.

My department is new business related, definately not essential at time like this but still company want us to fullforce working, some higher level can go work from home, thats all. 

Moreover there is a confirmed case happened in the office. Only people surrounding him get to quarantine. Everyone else have to come to work normally.

 Since you are fond of her, no pundek mumbling..only a big Sighhh!.Aiyaaaaa.  You manage to say' Weii, mampuih loo macam nie, next time You ' all combine everything, sent 1 email to me laaa' .. 'Hihihihi.. nobody said anything wooo!, you tell boss lah' . Confused, You ask ""So, that day what you all meeting?"" . ' 'Dunno , Hihihihi , you take care arrr.. byeee!' .. .weii PunDekkk laaa . you tried to scream into the phone.. 

You then print a couple of  copies, the dot matrix printer screaming sound, wakes you up frm yr daydream. Finally! siap semua. You staple all copies, lay them out on boss table n also yr other colleagues table. mumbling incoherently... 

You then, tutup office, shuts down all switches ( yr Boss voice in yr head ""Make sure arrr, tutup semua . Nanti bole meletop!Oooo) . You walked down the stairs, cos not wanting to risk breathing  the  lift air, God knows hw much the virus hs multiplied in there, just waiting for you.

[MalayMail] Foodpanda delivery rider dies in collision in N.Sembilan | Malaysia,,"This is a rather unfortunate news. 

Although this was bound to happen due to how the riders ride. Delivery incentives by food delivery companies should be amended to not reflect delivery time as the such a heavily weighted contribution to their income. 

If anything, it should be more of a delivery within time and you're good, deliver it earlier than time, you get a fixed bonus. Then you will need a cooldown for the timer of the last order to lapse in order to receive a new order for pick-up. This way riders should ride safe and don't have the incentive to speed that much.

I am hoping that Anthony Loke can do something about this, as he has a good track-record on implementing laws that keep people safe. In my opinion, this won't be just a lack of enforcement issue, because if the incentives of speeding is there, the riders would speed nonetheless, and the coverage area is too wide for enforcement. || Takziah dan Al Fatihah kepada keluarga Allahyarham. || Nowadays riders like to not obey traffic lights.

But i wonder why it always takes a death or twelve for the authorities to act on something that is generally accepted to happen sooner or later. || why is this news to be honest.....because he is a good panda rider? hundreds of mcyclist die a month || >fixed bonus

Any sort of bonuses that involves early timings should not be allowed. || I think you honestly meant your question, so will try to answer rather than modding you down.

Food/courier riders are known to often ride dangerously and often breaks the law. They are often a danger to themselves and the general public. There may be a systemic cause for this behaviour if this is the norm rather than the exception.

Putting the death of this rider into the news hopefully   pulls this topic into the public discourse. If enough attention is given, eventually public servants are pressured to take action and do something about it.

A different example is accidents involving drunk drivers. By exposing more of these incidents into the news, this enters public discourse and the police and transport are pressured to take action. There were news earlier about the police going to conduct more stops and checks for drunk drivers. Whether this be effective to pressure the drinking public to behave better and opt not to drive remains to be seen but this is a start.

Hope this helps! || Because people love pushing narratives thru social media.

This man exposed trash littered everywhere in a Malaysian forest. It included Foodpanda delivery bags.,," 

Andy  Hickson was just minding his own business, going for a trek in a   jungle just outside of Gombak. And look what he came across.

Hickson looks at the camera before panning to record the piles of trash littered across the jungle floor.

""Foodpanda stuff. That's the main culprit,"" he says. ""There's a whole load of Foodpanda stuff down there dumped in the jungle.""

And  true enough, lying among the piles of plastic containers and  trash  bags around Hickson are several of Foodpanda's iconic pink   driver-delivery bags.

People online were quick to share the Facebook post and many shared that they were disappointed, but not surprised

Many Southeast Asian countries are known to have become [dumping grounds](https://sea.mashable.com/science/5008/bloomberg-says-these-southeast-asian-countries-are-responsible-for-64-of-world-trash-gets-roasted) for other nations' trash. And Malaysia is no different.

In April, the Malaysian government announced that a [full-force clampdown on illegal plastic waste being imported](https://sea.mashable.com/science/3428/malaysia-plans-to-send-back-plastic-wastes-to-countries-of-origin)   into the country.

Rivers nearby those residential areas were also found to   contain toxic chemicals.

The  battle against trash continues on in the country and across the  world.  For now, Malaysians can do their part by recycling and properly   disposing their trash in their respective areas.

Also, it should be noted that right now, FoodPanda workers are no longer paid wages but instead are paid solely on deliveries. That means they are paid much less than even regular workers.

The difference in price between grabfood and onsite,"This is common knowledge, but it's always eye opening to see the price difference. The 33% higher price for grabfood lets the cafe cover back the grab commission. Have you seen any place that has smaller percentage gap?","While I agree sometimes it's extreme, the price gap appears even larger because Grab includes all charges upfront. You still need to pay SST on top of the menu pricing in the second picture. 

If menu prices were to start reflecting the full cost inclusive of charges, people will be surprised to see how much they're actually paying per item. || Grab also need to make money tbf. So the. Vendor has to cover it by increasing the price. That what you pay for convenient and delivery service is luxury || bro, Grab ain't doing charity || people need to know delivery service is a luxury. || There's price to pay for the luxury service of food being delivered to your doorstep. || It's not fair comparison to be honest. If you value your time, what price do you put on it? If you deny the operators the right to earn from doing the extra such as packaging and delivery, who's being unreasonable here?



If the seller could fling the food to you and skip the delivery person, I'm sure he would, but then you will complain it wasn't packed properly enough to withstand the shock of delivery😂😂😂



As someone has already mentioned, delivery is a luxury. 10 years ago this wouldn't even be an issue. We would be disciplined in our food consumption and maintain a healthy lifestyle.


We would also travel for food and incidentally enjoy other benefits like discovering fascinating places.

"Grab's services contributed RM9.9 billion to Malaysia's economy in 2023, about 0.5% of the country's GDP",,"Such a depressing state of affairs. Our transit landscape is so fucked up that a company centralised a taxi service, making enough money to branch off to start a digital bank. Meanwhile the gig workers who keep the company afloat earn pennies while they drive around for hours to scrape by. || While Grab's service may increased economic activity but it doesn't generate new wealth nor the wealth stayed within Malaysia.

It is a capital flight where the profit is an existing wealth outflow out of the country.

Unless we continuously generating new wealth to counter the outflow, all may be well.

I never used Grab or other similar services, but it seems these companies are changing gears to earn profit and reduced workers' compensation, at the same time the demand is reduced relative to the pandemic.

It also created a culture of delivery riders impervious to traffic law, and being a menace to other road users.

Everything have a cost. || Grab is a parasite where delivery guys are underpaid, restaurants have to overcharge, and Grab gets all the money in between. They don't provide actual value.

The infographic says Grab contributed 9.9b. I say Grab consumed 9.9b. || In defense of grab, shopeefood and foodpanda, I believe they've given many young folks who struggle to hold down regular jobs something that resembles a job. They make a somewhat livable sum of money (i heard they make like 2-4k a month), and that allowed many of them to avoid a life of crime. I actually believe the presence of these grabs helped to reduce crime throughout the country, and for that reason alone I wish they remain around. 

Grab is also historically unprofitable ( i recall they are still lossmaking? They are hoping the gxbank is the one that makes money to subsidize the rest of the co). So, I actually don't begrudge khazanah for not investing. 

Look at Grab's post listing share price. from $10 now only $5. 50% down. || Now calculate how much net profit they made || Inb4 - tapi rider majority orang kita. || And to think about it, Khazanah kicked them out of investment stages that they went to Singapore's branch of investment and secured it there. We lost a literal unicorn in investment bbecause Khazanah thought we can make our own SHEIN. || A selfish business strategy you may say, but its an effective and probably efficient business strategy rather than previous infrastructure (ie public taxi) where uncertainty and untruthful plague it pre-Grab era.

I rather use a selfish business where I know the price and the direction rather than a business that have no idea where they are going and charge inconsistently, up and down like a roller coaster. || How does it not generate new wealth when it created an additional opportunity for people to earn money with their vehicles? How does it not generate new wealth when it opened up market for even roadside stalls to customers that may had not been aware of them all this while?

If Grab was paying crazy dividends, then I'd agree that Grab is only taking money out of the country. But seeing that they're only barely reported a profit last year and just recently had positive cash flow, that doesn't seem quite right.

Bro, not all companies outside of Malaysia are ""bad"" per se. If all ""foreign"" companies are only deemed as leeches who are draining our cash, then we would've been stuck in pre-independence era. || I’m not defending Grab but isn’t the whole point of Grab is that business doesn’t have to build their own delivery/online platform?",17/2/2025,70,33,1739801016,malaysia,grabfood,https://i.redd.it/jnlwwltnhpje1.jpeg

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

Wholesome GrabFood Moment (read caption),"Yesterday I ordered GrabFood and requested cutlery as I didn't have any being a guest in a hotel room.

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe...

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

Grab Account Suspended?,"My mum Grab account somehow got suspended, and she tried to appeal it thru the online appeal form, and they told her that she got outstanding payment? 

My mum is not so tech savvy so she don't dare to use any online payment for Grab, she mostly just use GrabFood maybe once or twice a week with cash payment, and only time she use GrabCar is when she had to service her own car.

Funny thing is, they told her she got outstanding payment but there isn't any guidance on how to pay it, but also her account is suspended so she can't even login to Grab app.

So what's the quickest way to contact Grab support? And how did my mum even got outstanding payment if she only use cash payment on delivery?

GrabFood Now Lets You Avoid Small Order Fees By Purchasing Vouchers - Lowyat.NET,,"Pay rm4 now and for your next order, you ""Avoid"" the rm2 small order fee!

This is a scam. You're essentially paying those small order fees in this order, for a potential saving on your next order. If your next order isn't small, you're already paying for it. 

Where is Grab learning these tactics?? They're so slimy I'm being really repulsed to even order with them

* First order already rm2 small order fee
* Buy voucher rm 4
* Rm 2 from the voucher covers next order, can't use voucher on current order
* You've already paid them rm6 in advance.

What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?,"Spent a year in Bangkok during the pandemic when they were handing out unlimited ""Covid extensions"" before travelling around elsewhere. I've been back in Malaysia recently and I noticed things have changed so much before I left. Mostly, what's with all the shortened opening hours?

Most 7-Elevens in my area (Mont Kiara, KL) and the surroundings are closed by midnight.   
FamilyMart shuts by 2 am.  
The only convenience store that opens 24 hours is KK Mart but it almost never has anything I want.

Also, GrabFood's severely limited past midnight, with little other than *mamaks* and Middle Eastern food (coming all the way from Bukit Bintang).

I'm mostly awake during US working hours, so the limited options available is really getting to me.

I've lived in KL since 2006 and I remember the city used to have much more life in the past-midnight hours.

Have things really changed a lot since 2021, or is it just me?","Yeah, people have begun to demand actual living wages and better working hours.

That, and the stronger restrictions on immigration that made it harder for foreign workers to enter. || Lack of workers due to a somewhat recovering economy and some issues with importing workers from Bangladesh

People are now opting for actual jobs, as the job market is slowly recovering while the supply of foreign workers was stopped for quite a while during COVID and afterwards due to syndicates/negotiations (notice how Mamak restaurants were understaffed a few months ago?) 

In other words, those sectors you see with short opening hours are understaffed and are not hiring enough people

The number of Grab drivers has decreased significantly due to smaller commissions and the economy recovering, so a lot of the previously unemployed who worked with Grab are now getting proper jobs || Many places that used to operate 24hours already cut down their operating hours post covid. 

People also more careful with their spending. || Other premises I'd probably just chalk it up to lack of demand.

But what I don't understand is Grab(Taxi) operating hour: aren't you suppose to haul a taxi instead of driving yourself when you're night drinking outside? 

What's the point of it if they stop operating pass 12 am? 

If it's the hassle of working pass 12 am, Uber already have a solution of allowing them charge high price to compensate for it. || for consumers? yes it’s good to have 24hrs shops for convenience. However, lots of European countries close much earlier than that. This is because workers are humans too, and they need a great work-life balance. I’m not saying we should be like them, but things are not the same as before, people are tired of taken advantage to work long hours. I think we are approaching a better path rather than having a standard for being too convenient all the time. || 24hr shift work not good for health.

I argue that shift work should be abolished except for essential services workers like healthcare - for those working shifts, more days off must be granted in lieu.

>What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?

Sorry but the way you phrase the question sounds like an entitlement to me. 

People deserve better working hours and conditions. || I asked the same question to the staff of the local FamilyMart (closes by 11pm) and 7-11 (closes at midnight). They both used to be 24-hour outlets but not anymore since the height of the pandemic. Even after PKP 3.0 i.e. Abah’s Last Stand, they never reverted to their original operating hours. When I asked, the staff replied that the owners of the respective outlets felt that after-midnight sales are not enough to justify opening at those hours, so the owners decided to close before/by midnight. The local KK continues to be a 24-hour outlet even to this day, but the owner makes do by switching off the air conditioning in the store, and have only 2 staffers in the store past midnight. || Less purchasing power due to not good economy thus shop limiting their hours plus convenience store like 7e prone to get rob also due to people get lay off they turn to being criminal. || You have to understand that it's a commercial decision as AFAIK our government doesn't require businesses to pay workers more if their shifts are outside traditional working hours, so long as the working hours don't exceed the maximum allowed. .
(different from some countries like Australia where govt impose penalty/restriction on some businesses opening late)

So in malaysia if they close early is likely because business operations realised they won't make a good profit extending their hours, maybe cause employees want more pay outside traditional working hours, or infrequent customers to justify the expense. || Who in MK is going to work past midnight? the staff don't stay there. 

I mean the people in MK who worked in the 7E and McDs and whatever, were bored young people with rich parents. It was really something to do to pass the time. After COVID maybe they don't want to work there any more because they don't want to wear a mask all day, or they don't want to risk COVID or whatever.",8/2/2024,91,32,1707354035,malaysia,grabfood,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1alj3ai/what_is_with_the_short_opening_hours_in_malaysia/
Is it viable to do Grabcar part time as a student? How much income can I expect?,"Hi guys. I'm currently a uni student. I want to get some side income and be less of a burden on my parents. I asked for several restaurant jobs and the maximum amount they'll pay for part timers is RM1800. That's not enough for me as i want at least RM 2000/mth to be able to afford my next semester fee and cover my living costs. 

Now, I wanted to ask if RM2000-3000/mth is attainable as a part time grab driver? Would you recommend doing grabcar as part time? Some of my friends recommended grabfood or foodpanda but i'm really not interested in riding my bike all day long, which can be very tiring and not to mention, dangerous. 

For context, I live in JB. As a grab customer, i've noticed the fares are extremely high nowadays, To go to any malls from my house (12-20KM) i pay at least RM15 and it exceeds RM 30 during rush hours, sometimes even hitting RM 60! I think as a grab driver, there is plenty of opportunities for me here. 

I love driving so i don't mind long hours of driving. I can work for 2-4 hours a day and full day on weekends. So, around 30-40 hours a week. What do you guys think and any advice for me?","[https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012](https://www.lowyat.net/2023/292409/grab-effectively-increases-klang-valley-peak-hour-fares-to-compensate-driver-partners/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%2010%20km,slightly%20higher%20at%20RM%2012).

**\*\*You can use this as a rough calculation:\*\***

Fare per km : 25 sen

Cost of fuel per km : 12.5 km divided by 2.05 (1 litre) = 16.4 sen

Profit excluding wear and tear and cost of car = **9 sen per km**.

Optimistically, **50km per hour x 40 working hours x RM0.09 x 4 weeks** and you'll get:**RM720.**

Fare per minute : 43 senOptimistically, on 40 hours, you get a total of 30 hours of rides.**30 x 60 x RM0.43 = RM774**

In those 40 hours, you get 80 passengers.**80 x RM2 = RM160**

I'll add an additional 20% to account for peak hour rides and tips.

Total you should get roughly:**(720+774+160)\*1.2 = 1,984.80**

Grab is a decent supplementary income but you only really make money if you are able to commit absurd amount of time (>100 hours/ week for the multipliers). I can only assume your car is fully paid because **you can roughly deduct RM250 from the wear and tear, reducing your profit to effectively 1.7k/month.**

My advice : The return on time and effort spent is barely viable. Go into part time sales which pay commissions. Flexible and depending on your skill/effort, would pay off more. Furthermore, you can list that down in your resume upon graduation as sales is a highly valued job experience because it involves a lot of soft skills that can be applied to any roles due to its extrapersonal jobscope.

Edit : I worked sales part time on weekends in shopping mall during my uni days (2013-2016). || Grab car is just as tiring and difficult, when u wait for passenger suddenly felt the need to go toilet, u have to finish the job, go to petrol station or park properly at restaurants to tumpang toilet. For motorcycles just park anywhere go find toilet, continue to delivering your food delivery. So if u stuck in jam while holding in your pee, worst time of your life


Pay rate do increase for grab driver in peak hours to incentivise driver to take more job from that area, reason for rate hike is too few drivers is in the area or at the time, any driver get to u drives quite far to get to u, but generally grab will take around 12-20% commission, deduct in the credit wallet for driver


The hassle for your yearly renewal of your roadtax is more worrysome for u, as your car is remark as “kereta dagang” in JPJ systems, your roadtax cannot be done in MyEG or any POS Malaysia office, you need to do renewal at JPJ office, long queue and terrible officer attitude, 8 counter only 4 open, god forbid u forgot to bring one document, JPJ offficer no give face, cannot renew roadtax, queue again 4 hours next day, even after u remove your car from association with grab, your car still need to do PUSPAKOM inspection


For PUSPAKOM, u will be to buy fire extinguisher and first aid kit?(not sure but i keep one), tinted is regulated at front side ketulusan cahaya 70%, all other side is 50% and 70%, do this yearly


You also do need to take into account the repairs and maintenance for your car, as you make your car work double for u, wear and tear is also double fast, so u need to set aside some money for that, u will need to do bi yearly body health check JPJL8 form to renew your PSV license (different thing to your CDL)


For car Insurance, u will have 2, 1 for normal use, another is whenever u drive for grab car, since u do part time, the insurance is count by daily, deduct from your credit wallet. So if normal use u accident, it will take longer for your car insurance to do claim, as they need evidence the time of your driving is outside grab car driving, they will try to push for grab car insurance to pay the claims


If all these procedures is okay with u, then go ahead

I would rather work part time for something else if i have the know how or network/social skills, because the uncertainty and how tiring the part time job is

I only drive at night, but my day job is very undemanding, hence I can drive long hours at night. The KPI I set myself is minimum 6 hours or RM 150 profit per night.

As an aside, you can earn myr 5k or more monthly building software as a side hustle. Try browsing Upwork or any other freelancing or remote job boards.

There’s nothing wrong with working part time in a restaurant or driving grab per se, but there’s the opportunity cost of time that can be used to reinforce your learnings.

Your overarching goal should be to learn and to prepare yourself for your eventual career. The money will come later. || There's one post recently from 1 grab driver (KL area iirc) asking bout some opinion. If I'm not mistaken from his post,  your payrate is still the same regardless if it's rush hour or chill hour. If it's not in this subreddit, probably in r/bolehland. Good luck searching. || Grab take some % too from the fee. As general rule maybe say you get 50% from the fee. Considering petrol, maintenance etc. Maybe grab drivers can advise better. || I don't think you can. Not because of your age, but because Grab doesn't allow part-timers any longer.

Edit:

GrabFood and FoodPanda prices,"So title says it all. For reference I stay around the KL area, recently. So far this is the first time I've experienced it and was hoping someone else could explain it to me?

Experience with Malaysia's food delivery service,"Hello all! I would like to know if you guys have a very bad experience or good ones with some of the food delivery services available in your area?

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof. I was already like ""how do I show proof of something I don't have?"". So then I called the customer service line (had to wait 10 mins Btw) and ask for details. The person explains that I needed to take a picture before eating and show all the things I get, which I guess make sense to always check what you received. Still, it's so frustrating to get punished for this. I'm one burger short, hungy, no refund, and angy! 

I've had missing items when ordering from Grabfood but never got any problem with the refund. it's almost always instantly approved. So what about you guys? any horrible ones you had?","Even in business, you are expected to inspect your goods ordered when delivered.

Order came, one item missing in the set. I took photos as evidence, requested a refund. Waited for follow up asking for evidence but realized the refund(the amount of the set, not the price of that item) just get approved (without the need of photos) 

Kinda feel bad. They rugi the whole set just because one missing item.

 But then realized it is KFC. Fxxk KFC anyway for all those tiny chicken 🤣 || my experience is wait half an hour and get order cancelled. || Been using food delivery services and always check if ur items are missing the moment u receive the item not after u makan.

Do u think they will entertain u? || Top tip: Don't use Shopee Food || [deleted] || Don't try this in big season during cny they can't handle it || [deleted] || To be fair, it is difficult to prove that you did not receive the burger since you didn't take any photos upon reception. However I believe the platform does have a ""reputation system"". Maybe if it's your first time complaining then the CS will side with you despite it is your mistake for having insufficient evidence. But for future complains, they can see your records and make judgements from there..im not saying that you're trying to cheat but it's something to think about",28/1/2023,167,100,1674876721,malaysia,grabfood,https://i.redd.it/4z0hrnfewqea1.jpg
[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Menu Price Difference on GrabFood,"So, recently I noticed that the menu  items of a particular restaurant are different by ~RM3-RM4 on GrabFood compared to their in-store price. The thing is they explicitly mentioned that the prices are same as in-store on their menu page in GrabFood. I did saw a post similar to this in this subreddit. However, can anyone please tell what can be done regarding this? Is there somewhere we can report this?","There will always be a difference. Nobody will do a business where they lose money, Grab takes 31.8% off of everything in the menu, so if a restaurant sells for the same price as in store, they will be losing 31.8% of profit plus plastic for takeaway packaging. 

The easiest way is to not use their service unless really really have to. One pandemic and they think they're an unstoppable service/business.

He’s talking about cases where the price is stated to be same in-store when it’s not.

Situations like this happen because some shops (advised by Grab onboarding team i guess) specifically print a separate menu just for Grab verification purposes. Or specify different prices on their menu just for takeaway/delivery. Or have special bundles just for delivery while not selling individual, cheaper, items.

There are a lot of tricks and loopholes they’re using to get away with displaying “prices are same as in store”.

Grabfood prices(face to face noodle),"So, basically I decided to go buy there instead of using grabfood, then after checking the receipt I realised all the dishes in grabfood are more expensive by another rm3 on the menu, I think not including delivery price. If two noodle then it's an extra rm6 compared to the actual price in the store. Not including delivery price.

The thing is grabfood stated on the store menu that it is in store prices for that shop, and that doesn't mean an extra rm3 for everything is reasonable within range for food. 

So is this something normal I should bear with. Or is it not normal,  how do I report this problem then? I'm new to food delivery, mercy.  I didn't order through grabfood this time, only compared the prices.","The thing is Grab imposes a cut of 15-30% from store sales. So the shop have no choice but to raise their prices to cover the margin.

Edit: On the argument that grab that states  ""menu price is same as in-store"". 
Technically yes, shop owner need prove their price by uploading their menu. But here's the catch, it's a separate menu just to raise the margin.
Source: close friend who owns a cafe. || Yep caught a few doing this. Honestly I don't mind if they are upfront that the prices are higher than in-store. However if you claim that you are same in-store price that is  in the wrong. || Bruh they've been doing this since the start of grab food. || Yeap most of the times always cheaper to order food yourself at the store.


However, Grab does offer the convenience of you not needing to transport your food and waiting for your food to be done. || >The thing is grabfood stated on the store menu that it is in store prices for that shop

this is what I know from a few restaurant shop owners. the right procedure is Grab will go to the restaurant and check their restaurant menu, but it has become lenient recently, probably because of lack of manpower || Just to add on, the answer is a bit more nuanced than that. I learnt a bit about the f&b scene after watching a podcast with myburgerlab owner ([link](https://youtu.be/fJBqSqKR8ck?t=2842)), it's a bit long but I highly recommend it.

I'll give a tldr, pre-covid, food delivery commission was alright, even if takeaway food usually have smaller earning than dine-in. When covid hit, food delivery starts to increase commission saying covid hitting their margins, f&b doesnt have negotiation power because otherwise they cant earn during mco. But food delivery app also introduces discount to user, you can imagine how small the margin are left for f&b business. On top of that, ingredient costs are at all time high. The extra rm6 you are paying is for f&b to earn back their margin that gets eaten by app, otherwise the f&b business won't be sustainable. You can imagine how much food delivery app companies are earning as middleman. || Yeah it’s expected because Grab is taking a % cut.     

However, Some stores DO have real in-stores prices if you select “pick up” as the option. And that’s why I like foodpanda more. It has that juicy 15% pickup. 20% if you are a subscriber. Sometimes it’s so cheap it feels like I’m stealing. || don't use food delivery if you can. You pay higher price; the restaurant gets lower profits; you are increasing your single-use plastic usage; you are supporting a system that incentives reckless driving and worker abuse; || That's the way they became billion dollar company. Hence eating up margin is their only way of bussiness. Same like grabcar etc. Literally middle men big brother. But tbh its much more convinience than going to buy yourself. Calculate tge effort, parking, tolls if any, and obviously petrol cost. The best way to save money if u persist is just cooked at home yourself. || Do report, the shop is not being honest.",14/4/2022,15,20,1649914866,malaysia,grabfood,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/u3a82k/grabfood_pricesface_to_face_noodle/

Uncultured Grabfood & Foodpanda riders.,"Some of y'all really need to be restricted from any forms of access to a motorcycle. You got lives at home to feed but what about other lives on the road be it car drivers/pedestrians? 

Since March 2020, some of y'all been:

1. Breaching red traffic lights and when honked, there you go flashing that middle finger of yours or looking at me as if its perfectly normal.

2. Riding at least 80km/h over zebra crossings at schools with students around. School freakin students. Are you that of a degenerate? Schools reopened, yall dont own the road like you used to. 


It doesn't just happen in only 1 particular state. The nature of my work require constant travel and I'm sick of the risk that I have to anticipate on a weekly basis.","I have a Chinese friend who looks Malay with an English name common to Both races. Whoever he orders non-halal food, without even asking for clarification, he’s had riders preach and scold him for being unfaithful bla bla. He got pissed to actually say “f* God” and dare them to report him to Jakim.

There's lots of caveman motorcyclists on the roads.

After coming back from a round-the-Peninsular 2,500km bike trip, I've reached a similar conclusion that I did from travelling in other countries: people are just nastier in bigger cities.

Road manners were so much better in the countryside and the people I managed to converse with were much friendlier and kinder. Living in close proximity with lots of people stresses the animal side of our brains, I guess. || You forgotten the rempit menace turned into employed riders. I for one am happy these guys are now working rather than taking drugs || It's amazing to see how people giving bullshit reason to justified these reckless riders.

Many times in my own residential area they’ll shoot out at junctions without looking at the main road. I’m not even going fast, maybe 20-30 km, and they can still nearly hit me. Then they have the gall to flip me off too. 

Half the time I see them looking at their phones. I mean c’mon la, I know you need to work, but do so safely. Check your phone at the side of the road and when you’re stationary. If you get hurt after you hit me, I’m the one in the wrong as usual too. || This literally happened to me yesterday, Grab Rider with passenger sped through a red light as I was slowly lurching forward, If I moved any faster for sure collide || One time I ordered from FP, like my house is 40-45min from the town so I don’t mind getting it even if it passed an hour.

If i order take away, its only from restaurants that have their own like mcdonalds.

foodpanda/grab add at least rm 10 on top of what you order for example. If just 1 guy order, thats crazy expensive.

The drivers drive like crazy. Whether i drive or walk, they are a menace. They park blocking cars even when theres a large pavement or motorcycle dedicated spots with space right next by.

They drive on large pavements, often almost hitting me many times when i walk.

ANd ofcourse when they beat red lights and get hit, it causes delays for everyone else, and they dont even have to pay for the damage they cause.

They will drive the wrong side of the road even on narrow one way roads, or even highways. A few times i've had to dodge an incoming biker on an exit going the wrong way even when there is an exit path leading the direction that the biker wants very easily.

They can run over people and still not have to pay anything (malaysian law favours motorcyclists). If you dont want mat rempits in the first place, both the law and police are needed, but police dont even care if bikers drive like mad, as they themselves dont even drive properly.

Does anyone still able to use GrabPay on modified devices?,"This is my previous post a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab\_wallet\_suspending\_soon\_for\_modified\_devices/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab_wallet_suspending_soon_for_modified_devices/)

I just wanted to ask: does anyone with Magisk still able to use or it's a no since 6/1/2021?

During that time, I still able to use even after 6/1/2021. But now, I can't anymore. Wallet is there with balance but grab just acted like it knows I'm using Magisk or has root, and prohibits me from using GrabPay. Grab even asked me for root access, which clearly indicates that the app is able to detect root. TouchNGo and all other apps are working, thus there's no problem with the Magisk Hide. 

It's been a while since I last used Grab so I'm not sure about this, hope someone could shed some light on this. If I'm not mistaken, few months back it is still working because I attempted to place GrabFood order and seems to work just well. 

Sigh, very inconvenient.","i have another android rooted with magisk with grab installed. i can still open the app and everything works as usual. did you install xposed? || [deleted] || Never. Never used xposed since I moved to using Magisk, haha..

I do have an app called ""Taichi"" and I wonder it causes the detection. I will try to remove that and see. Other than that, I have no more idea, since TNG, ShopeePay, Boost all working fine.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/  
it was made last year, i dunno what happen to that website though. || one more reason why we need more competition in food delivery service || I tot Rafizi Ramli already started one?

"How much do delivery riders earn, on average?","Hey monyets, I'm an intern, rn. Least I can say is, the corporate market is looking a hell of a lot worse since COVID started.

Anyway, I'm opting to start out as a Foodpanda Rider after I graduate. The thing is tho, I'm curious of the statistics. I have enough savings to get a bike, and since food delivery is gonna be going around for a while, I'm planning of doing it too 

So.. how much on average, do grabfood, foodpanda, or any delivery riders earn if it was in a city? 

How many months can I expect to pay off the bike I bought? The ones under 150cc, etc...

Is it a worth it job to get some extra cash after graduation? To pass the time, even?

Just wanna get some insight from the delivery riders out there. Thanks!","hi bro, im a food panda rider. But just part time since im still doing my degree. So in a week i work for just about 3 days and usually around 5 hours per day. sometimes less than that. I can made around rm600 per month. So if u do full time, im sure u can reach 2K || As part-time ok else it will cost more to you in long term. The biggest drawback is you don't learn anything from the delivery gig job. || It's probably not worth it if you factor in depreciation, time and petrol. You are better off using the time to make yourself marketable to employers. || I see, bro. Thanks for the insight, 600/month as spare change is not bad, tbh. || Yeah true, its just the same thing day after day, I guess u can be pretty bored after a while. || Yea, breaking even is gonna be hard, if u factor those in. Just hope employers are still looking for people to work for them in this economy. || Lets not forget that when the economy reopens employers will be seeking to rehire those they let off previously (maybe not the same individuals, but similar situations), so you'll be competing with veterans regardless. But depending on industry I think its still pretty good odds to get a job so long as you dont set your asking salary too high, since employers will be dealing with tight budgets then. 

&#x200B;

Honestly tho, I dont really think its such a big thing to consider depreciation. If you're using that bike only for delivery, then sure its something to think about. But if that bike is also gonna be your transportation for other stuff, then you basically dont have to pay money for a car or public transport anymore. Petrol wise.... I dont think its an issue either, since motorbikes arent subject to traffic jams the way cars are, so long as you're being efficient with your fuel (refrain from unnecessary accelerating and braking). Time on the other hand... if you already have a job, then sure.. focus on that. If you're unemployed I'm pretty sure you dont spend 17 hours a day surfing jobstreet and looking for a job. Surely spending 3-5 flexible hours a day earning side income doing deliveries is possible. My neighbor is retired and he's doing Grab deliveries with a car for a few hours a day, and he tells me the income is enough to cover the car's loan and give him some pocket money to spend. The other dude is doing this while still being a student, so I'm sure you can manage (assuming of course you dont have a job right now) doing both delivery job and making yourself marketable for employers.",27/5/2021,9,7,1622134883,malaysia,grabfood,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/nmc1in/how_much_do_delivery_riders_earn_on_average/

What to Expect from a Malaysian Quarantine Centre in KL,"Hi all! I want to tell you all about my ongoing experience as a Person Under Surveilance (PUS) in Kuala Lumpur. Hopefully this will be useful information of you are travelling home soon. I am a Malaysian Student travelling back from the UK. I arrived in KLIA on 27 July. 

After touchdown in KLIA, we were all given COVID swab tests before being allowed to pass through immigration. After everyone from your flight has done the test and gone through immigration, you will be taken to a hotel to complete your quarantine. The whole process from touchdown to the hotel check in took 6 hours despite there only being around 30 people on my flight. There was a lot of queuing and waiting around, and you are expected to wear a mask and face shield at all times. We were given some refreshments while waiting for the others after immigration but I still suggest you make sure you have your own water and plenty of masks so you can keep yourself comfortable. ***Remember to bring your own pen to fill out any documents and bring a hard-copy of everything, like your flight itinerary, letter of undertaking, approval letter to return to Malaysia, etc.

Everyone from my flight was checked into the Holiday Inn Express in KLCC. The room was immaculately clean, ensuite, lots of water and toilet paper provided, but unfortunately the windows do not open so no fresh air. There is a desk in the room too so it is definitely quite comfortable for one person to stay here alone but I couldn't imagine being cooped up here with someone else. 

Food is delivered 3 times a day within a certain time frame but they are often late. My hotel does not accommodate to dietery requirements such as vegetarian or vegan, and everyone is expected to eat rice, curry and chicken. You can order special meals at an extra charge and these will be delivered to your room instead of the standard fare. As a Malaysian with no special dietery requirements however, I think the food so far has been delicious even though it is usually cold by the time it is delivered to me. 

The system for ordering meals and extra ameneties such as coffee, sugar, tea or water is very disorganised and conducted entirely through whatsapp. Ringing the reception does not guarantee you an immediate response and they will usually only deliver your requested items with your next mealtime. No outside food and drink is allowed to be delivered to the hotel and of course all PUSs are not allowed to leave their room, not even wander the corridor. ***the hotel is trying to accommodate vegetarians but from what I’ve heard through the WhatsApp group, it’s not the best but at least they are trying. 

There is an intercom system with speakers installed in every room. The speaker's are very loud and there is no escaping it, the hotel management will announce warnings and reminders to stay in our rooms and threaten us with repercussions. It gets very annoying, especially when they are announcing it at 8am in the morning in multiple languages. 

Here are the things I suggest you pack with you for comfort during your quarantine: 
1. Metal utensils to eat with (only plastic utensils are provided by the hotel)
2. Your own shampoo and conditioner (the hotel only provides all-in-one soap)
3. A data plan for your own internet connection (the hotel wifi is very slow and a lot of people had trouble connecting to it. I wouldn't depend on it)
4. Snacks and condiments (you can technically order dry snacks via GrabFood or smth but I wouldn't depend on the hotel staff to bring it up to you in good time. No condiments provided with your food.) 
5. Cup noodles (in case you get bored of the standard meals)
6. Protein powder (meals are very carb heavy. Bad for gains)


***Update; 29 July: The fire alarm went off today which caused concern among the guests. Hotel management told us to stay in our rooms while they investigated the cause of the alarm. Turns out someone was smoking in their room. I pity them as they cannot go outside to smoke and it must really be killing them to have to endure this for 2 weeks. 

***1 August: Given a wristband and safety kit consisting of masks, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. I’ll be given another swab test on the 10th day and can go home if I it is negative. 

***I will keep updating this post with more information as it comes. I still have 12 days left in my quarantine.*** 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AT THE HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS. THERE ARE OTHER QUARANTINE CENTRES IN KL WHICH MAY PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE AND AMENITIES.","I have a few questions:

1. If you packed food with you in your luggage (e.g instant noodles, snacks etc) from your departing country, would they confiscate it? Coz since you say you need to pay extra for food and the ordering system is disorganised, maybe bringing some extra food over would help a little.
2. Do the hotel staff come in to the room, to clean it for example?
3. I know it's only day 2 for you, but how have you been keeping yourself entertained so far? What's your plan for the next 12 days? || Last time they were allowed to order foodpanda/grab or even shoppee lazada. Parents can drop clean cloth n stuff needed. Have you tried ask the person in charge there? (KKM?) || Any pics of food, the place, etc? || I want to know what is the pricing policy now as a Malaysian? How much do you need to pay, if any? || You mentioned a data plan and snacks. Do the authorities let you purchase these at the airport first before being quarantined? Assuming you're returning from overseas with an expired Malaysian SIM, hence no data plan, and you need to buy one. || Interesting.

We went through the same experience in both Auckland, New Zealand in March and then Melbourne, Australia in June. || Do they conduct any test on you so far? || Thanks for sharing! This is incredibly insightful for any returning Malaysian. What sort of documents or forms were you required to fill out prior to departure by the way? 

Glad to hear you got home safe though! Hope you aren't too dead bored in the centre. Keep us posted OP! || Seriously? I was lucky enough to come back during the period when I was allowed to stay at home for quarantine and only required to take another test after 14-days. Without paying a single cent. || Hi, just wondering when you go through immigration, what kind of questions did they ask you?",28/7/2020,65,35,1595920036,malaysia,grabfood,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/hza0km/what_to_expect_from_a_malaysian_quarantine_centre/

We are really disappointed and upset with the partnership with [**GrabFood**](https://www.facebook.com/GrabFoodMY/?__cft__[0]=AZX_4fh1IxKeGTQrsOCKR1k_MldU08svr_dQGnF9WaDQb8An2YI7dPrNKn5ecSzgbh4715QEpuH6CyScPfG9l58aQZMYW5JDBd5MyPuNeRUcTcU6hnKRajLCYlmopNtRA3yqtYpxBe4y-ySR7qOwgQKKyovWMLK65_m6NNfP4A4P-g&__tn__=kK-R). 

We have been on-boarded to GrabFood for more than a year now, and we have been a cooperating partner.   
Not until recently that we found out GrabFood has been very non-transparent in their assignation for restaurants availability in terms of radius. 

We have been receiving a lot of complaints from our customers about GrabFood not showing the availability to deliver within reasonable distance, and we thought this is due to GrabFood system that is set to be within a specific distance in each area. However what triggered the following case was on 26 May 2020, when we were alerted by our staff that GrabFood was unavailable for that day (imagine the sales that we lost, especially during this COVID period whereby businesses are struggling). Our sales from GrabFood on that day is ZERO. Upon checking, we realized other restaurants in same area is available but not us.

Hence we reached out to GrabFood merchant support via live chat and given the response that they off our restaurant availability from the back-end due to differences in commission rate by different restaurants, which means the restaurants which signed higher commission rate with them will get the priority and 'be available in more places'. And they switched on our availability back after our call.

We were very upset and escalated to the manager. He then gave us another explanation that GrabFood will allow restaurants with larger 'sales bucket' to appear in more places. If that's the case, it's discrimination against small businesses, or any businesses that have menu selling items with lower price.  
We gave feedback to them that this is not acceptable. And the manager promised to get back to us again after discussing with the team. It's been a week and we hear nothing from them.

Yet it happened again today..! We realized they 'turned off' our restaurant again after checking from the app. Hence we wrote a complaint again, and same cycle happened... (same canned response, and they switched back on)

We are deeply disappointed with such partnership relationship. Does this mean that we have to always check if our restaurant has been hidden from the platform? These occurrences have broken the trust, we don't know when their system will discriminate against us again and only switch back on after we found out and reach out to them each time. This is totally unfair to small and medium businesses. || Interesting, maybe this is why sometimes I see some restaurants in the same area being ""Unavailable for delivery"" despite being well within the riding distance, while others in the vicinity operate just fine. || Precisely why I don’t use these food delivery if I got the option. Their outreach into various industries for e-hailing, e-wallet and food delivery and the subsequent monopoly of the industry is extremely unsettling. || Time to switch to foodpanda? || 'Support your local heroes... who are willing to pay us more' || Capitalism at its finest... pretty shit of grabfood || Grab and Foodpanda charges around 30% commission, which has to be borne solely by the restaurants because they are prohibited from marking up their prices. If you sell your burger for RM10 on your menu, you can't change the price to RM13 on foodpanda to cover the commission. In an industry where profit margin is already thin, being on these platforms are not as great as it's hyped up to be. They're not there to help your business, they're there to help themselves. Fp and grab can suck it. 

If you want to support local businesses (as you should!), order takeaways or ask if they themselves can deliver. We did this during Ramadhan and we didn't even charge any delivery fee, and many local restaurants do the same. Support them directly! || [deleted] || Yeah. Was kind of expecting some shit like this to start happening already. For the most part, this is something that I expected “platforms” in the “sharing economy” to pull, sooner or later. It was one of the reason why I was so reluctant to get on Grab and their ilk, and only did it recently when I noticed the value of not having to rely on having cash to pay, and the fact that delivery was basically how we all stayed alive during the MCO.

So I do use these apps, but otherwise I try to reduce usage as much as I can. But yeah. Good to see that people are starting to realize what kind of shitty position you'll be put in when you start trusting these platforms. They want to maneuver you into a position where they become the sole buyer or seller of these services, and *then* the real hurting starts.

Incidentally: if you think that stopping the use of this platform and going to `$COMPETITOR` is going to make things better? It won't, if the competitor is another profit-making corporation. You're still going to get fucked over, it's just a matter of when.

It might be useful to see whether stuff like [platform cooperatives](https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad), where the platform is run and operated by the people who're doing the work, rather than some other entity skimming off the profits, might be something that Malaysians can come together with and bring up.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

This is a plea to all Malaysians.," To all the companies out there, the big CEOs, COOs, CTOs, board members, and bosses. Please, prioritise your employee's health and safety. 

Please, please, love your call centre staff, and all your front liners. If it's at all possible for your employees to work from home, even at a reduced efficiency, PLEASE LET THEM. 

The country NEEDS as many people as possible to stay home and stay safe. Your employees are scared and compromised every day they have to leave their homes. What if they get sick, what if they get caught by the police, what if the area they're in doesn't have food, what if the building they're in isn't as clean as it should be, what if they get sick, go home, and spread it to their parents or children. 

The medical infrastructure needs people to stay home, stay safe. Don't risk the spread, don't overwhelm our medical facilities. The more people are sick at the same time, the more people aren't going to be able to get the treatment they need, and that means a higher rate of death.

I get it though, while you sit at home now, your big worry now is how the company is going to survive financially and be able to continue providing for all employees in the future. That's why I say, if it's possible for them to work from home even at a reduced rate, let them.

Please, this is also not the time to worry about what the stupid customers who care about no one but themselves will say, this is the time to prove yourself as a leader of a business, and place your employees health and safety at the top of your priority list. 

&#x200B;

To all of us working from home, in comfort and safety. Please, give the brands and businesses a break. Don't bash them online for slower service, or long waiting times. Please understand the position everyone is in right now. Please don't be that person yelling at a service agent because you had to wait 45 minutes on a call. Don't be the person complaining at your slow internet because you can't watch Netflix. Don't be the person scolding Grabfood or Foodpanda for not giving good enough deals and/or fast deliveries.

Give them a break la please. Care for our fellow Malaysians and our neighbours.","[deleted] || Grab Food, Food Panda and BungkusIt Employers must give their riders free face masks and free hand sanitizers.

Masks aren't even provided, we have to buy them ourselves and we're running out of it. 7E waited for the last moment to close down, before MCO there was no warnings or precaution asked for us to take. They know most of us who work minimum wage are scared of losing our pay and so many people are willing to fill in the vacancies. || My company is registered under essential services. We work in the safety industry for maritime and oil&gas.

We decided to reduce our workforce by half each employee taking every other day off to reduce contact. Masks and hand sanitizers are offered for free. Any MC taken during this period will not be recorded.

Still our employee hates us, we cannot afford to close because there are vessels and platform depending on us. Our competitors are at full force, and we r forced to sub jobs to them because we r running with a skeleton crew.

The emails oh god, we just cannot even keep up. Every worker is wanting us to close while on the other hand every client is begging for us to remain operational.

We've gotten official letters that we r allowed to remain open. Our workers don't want to work. Our clients cannot afford for us to shut down.

A few employee even went as far as reported us to the police. They came and took a look around, green light us to remain open. 

What the fuck do I do? WHAT THE FLYING FUCKING SHIT DO I FUCKING DO?! U PEOPLE SO SMART FUCKING TELL ME! || Crisis time like this makes you realise how much company value their staff.

My company is under essential category, so the company worked with full force even with MCO announced. until 2 days later the govener email asking every CEOs to take the MCO seriously, some of the competitor went partial shutdown. Yet my company only allow a few of us work from home. Others BAU.

My department is new business related, definately not essential at time like this but still company want us to fullforce working, some higher level can go work from home, thats all. 

Moreover there is a confirmed case happened in the office. Only people surrounding him get to quarantine. Everyone else have to come to work normally.

Today my HoD just declared work from home for my whole department, without CEO approval, he say he'll bear any consequences. || Joke, my manager still expect performance like we work in office.

The current expectations are not even found in a normal day 🙃

Rather than reduce efficiency, they expect improve efficiency instead 🙃 || Right now I'm earning an extra ringgit for every full hour I'm working.

' 'Dunno , Hihihihi , you take care arrr.. byeee!' .. .weii PunDekkk laaa . you tried to scream into the phone.. 

You then print a couple of  copies, the dot matrix printer screaming sound, wakes you up frm yr daydream. Finally! siap semua. You staple all copies, lay them out on boss table n also yr other colleagues table. mumbling incoherently... 

You then, tutup office, shuts down all switches ( yr Boss voice in yr head ""Make sure arrr, tutup semua . Nanti bole meletop!Oooo) . You walked down the stairs, cos not wanting to risk breathing  the  lift air, God knows hw much the virus hs multiplied in there, just waiting for you.

You reached downstairs, relieved to see yr trusty motobike still parked where you left it 1/2 hour before, Suddenly you  start to panic!! reaching yr backpocket .looking for yr keys.

E-Tunai Rakyat: A primer,"You may have read the announcement that the government has [selected Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets are selected for the e-Tunai Rakyat initiative.](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tng-boost-grab-selected-etunai-rakyat-initiative)

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

Source: [ Touch 'n Go FAQ,](https://www.tngdigital.com.my/etunairakyat) 

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities.",""" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong. ""

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)
I don't use grabpay because there's no incentive for me to do so. || Thanks for sharing this post OP ! || i earn more than 100k a year. would the ewallet verify with lhdn if i sign up for it in the app? || The only reason I use TnG is for RFID/Pay direct at the toll i go through every day for work. There aren’t many incentives for now but the reload process is almost instant. Have yet to try Boost (didn’t like that I can’t transfer money out of the account - not sure if that’s changed recently) and grabpay doesn’t seem to be accepted everywhere yet. Nice to see we are moving towards a cashless society :) || I use touch n go ewallet on a daily basis because i hardly carry cash anywhere I go. I dont like the idea of withdrawing money at Atm and the most i carry in my wallet is rm5.

My spending habit changed tremendously. I only eat out at a place that accept ewallet/card payment. I only make withdrawals if i decide to go somewhere that will require cash. || Boost reverted policies (changing cashback to coins) really making me wana uninstal the app, but then i got rm10 out of the blue, i mean i had to postpone my thought for now. || Touch and Go presented our company with an additional problem, used to be we blindly allow our sales and service team to claim TNG receipt, now we have them to itemize their spending and restrict it to only toll and parking if they want to use the app (one dude claimed over 1k via TNG, we found out he use the e wallet to makan) || TBH they should just unify TnG card and TnG eWallet. Saves so much trouble. || As I'm a heavy user of RFID/TnG Paydirect, I'll definitely choose TnG e-wallet.

PSA: Price difference between FoodPanda and GrabFood,,"This screencap is from today 30/05/2019.

Grabfood may have very attractive subscription plans and promos, but ultimately their price hike is too much. If you have no promo codes, consider comparing prices as Grabfood will most likely be higher (approx 30%). This is consistent across more than three vendors I've personally ordered from so do your research as well. Sometimes even with promo codes, Foodpanda comes out to be cheaper. As Grabfood also commonly have a minimum, consider Foodpanda if you often do take out for one. Don't be blindly attracted by promos, as it's not always cheaper.

If you have a shopback account, Foodpanda is eligible for cash back as well.

If you are used to Grabfood, currently they have a voucher code that is rather good (EasyEats), thanks u/KuzaSasuke for the tip! But once this promo is gone, to Food Panda I will go.

TL;DR: **If you have no vouchers, avoid Grabfood at all cost.** || thats why I prefer standard fast food delivery. || GrabFood's item price is higher than Foodpanda's total. I have never used GrabFood, but from this it looks like I never will. || Would the difference be because of the Brown Sugar Warm Pearls? Or is the foodpanda order truncated? || Didn't know this one drink can cost me a full dinner of KFC for two || Which one provides better service?

I use foodpanda more. || Tealive recently increase their pricing on GrabFood for some unknown reason, maybe because of the commission percent set by Grab which cause them to increase the pricing.

GrabFood Tips,"Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Wrong delivery

&#x200B;

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

&#x200B;

* You can get partially refunded for an order that was wrongly fulfilled.","Was expecting tips on ordering or using GrabFood but found 2 cases of complaints instead. || r/unethicallifeprotips || My friend cheated by FoodPanda. I Sent voucher(first time user) to friend. Friend use first time user code, but restaurant cancel order because some items not available.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

Experience with Malaysia's food delivery service,"Hello all! I would like to know if you guys have a very bad experience or good ones with some of the food delivery services available in your area?

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof. I was already like ""how do I show proof of something I don't have?"". So then I called the customer service line (had to wait 10 mins Btw) and ask for details. The person explains that I needed to take a picture before eating and show all the things I get, which I guess make sense to always check what you received. Still, it's so frustrating to get punished for this. I'm one burger short, hungy, no refund, and angy!

Food delivery guys asking for charity money,"In 4 separate occasions, I had 4 different food delivery guys (Shopeefood and Grabfood) asking me to give them money when they deliver my meals.

I loathe the concept of filial piety and children treated at retirement fund,"Sorry if this should be flaired as “culture” or “vent” but I abhor the concept of filial piety, regardless of all the sayings that we were brainwashed with at school or by the media ie. “syurga di bawah telapak kaki ibu” or dongeng si Tanggang. 

I was raised with the importance of filial piety and all. We grew very rough but I was able to enter college and universities. The reason why it was rough was because I my eldest sister went to 3 universities and ran away each time when I was 11/12 and my parents were asked to pay for the uni loan/debt. My parents have to sold a land and downsize on car and house. In my college years I remember having difficulties for food and books and my mum barely could afford us siblings, having debts and everything.

When I was in college my scholarship money was given to my mother. I also remember that in university once, I came home in the weekends to my parents eating rice with salt all week. It broke my heart and I did everything I could while studying, being a dishwasher, hair model, call girl,escort (the trauma from the latter job is still unresolved until now in my 30s) you name it. I paid for my own school expenses, food and I was able to graduate. During those days I remember giving money to my parents and tried my best to give them good quality of life the best that I can.

For more than a decade I have been giving 1/3 of my salary (and now less because I have been earning better) to them as the youngest in the family. When my father passed away I gave about 10k USD for his funeral and have been paying for anything the best that I could- flights, car license, broken cars, medicines, grab rides, etc.

Today I called my mother and asked why do me and one of my sister have to pay for everything - house, food, electricity at a house that I don’t live in? I told her that it is fair if she could ask for everyone to pay equally, I don’t care if I have to pay more as long as it’s EQUAL. She said your eldest sister is married with a child, one of your brother is unemployed bla bla. But when I told her that I also was thinking of starting my own family and I am sure my other siblings are thinking of getting married too. I told her it’s unfair that my sister ran away when I was 11 and has not been paying her share at all but only pocket money once in awhile. She suddenly started crying and told me that she will ask everyone in the group chat. I told her that it is better for her to call or meet them face to face regarding all this. She said she does not care and will post there so everyone will see. She denied that I have started giving money since I was in uni. and asked me why I dwell so much about the past. When I told her about my feelings she said she have to go to bed because she had a headache and did not want to talk to me about this anymore.


I care about her but somehow I am annoyed for the fact that I am being guilt-trip each and everytime with filial piety and responsibilities, like everyone in Asia. I hate the fact of growing up having to think about money since I was a child and being controlled even when I am adult. I am in my 30s now and have been abroad from my home country for about a decade and realised the fact that my mother and father should not have kids if they cannot afford it.

I am sorry I am venting but this has been hurting me for a long time, especially if my effort to care for the family is not appreciated. I really am thinking about buying a house myself (the one that I live in not the house that I paid for and not live in) and start my own family. I really realise that my childhood and adolescent was abnormal when my parents used me and my sister as a retirement fund.

Addendum:  My eldest sister was knocked up and had ran away from home when I was 11/12 and is a housewife now (I went to another country in my 20s to look for her and brought her back to my family) and the other 2 were unemployed for a long time before they all working managerial posts. One is still unemployed.



Update : My mother said I did not have her money when I was in uni and abroad. I gave them money every months and sometimes gave 2.5K for my sister’s school. Maybe it’s old age but she claimed I did not give her money when I started working abroad. I went to check the statements and it was clear that I gave them money every month the best that I could even though I work my bones off abroad, not eating well and drowned by stress. I sent to her all the old statements and she said I can stop giving her money in May. I said I have already sent 4K before to one of my sisters, you can use that before my brother found a job. I told her I am going to stop giving her money because it is now others’ time to bear the burden.  I am very likely not going to give more and I don’t care about the house that I am paying, whoever lives there can continues to pay (ie. Unemployed brother, housewife/runaway sister).

I am in the process of buying a tiny house abroad and I think it’s time for me to start living my life without the stress and endless burden. I have been crying for two days straight and I am done and I am tired.

Thank you to all for the kind words and encouragement I really really appreciate them.","Hi OP, as someone who’s also working overseas and is being used as a retirement fund I feel you and I definitely agree that you need to set boundaries.

It took me getting into credit card debt that’s gonna take me a year to repay for me to realise I needed to start putting my foot down.

1/3 of your salary is way too high but leaving that aside you’re right that everyone should have to pay their fair share, no matter how little that is.

I’d say if your mother wants to air it out in the group chat then let her, she’s using it as a way to guilt trip you into backing down so that you don’t lose face, but in my opinion you have no face to lose since you are contributing the most! You have the right to dictate some terms. || I know this is harsh but I will go NC with the family. Problem is, you are not treated as one of the family member but as ATM. You know this yourself but just don't want to accept the fact. || Is your contribution used for your siblings’ living expenses? They feeling to complacent cz no work still can survive? You have the right to have a comfortable future too. If you arent married or even planning not to then the more reason you should plan for your retirement. So what if she wants to air it out in grp chat? Let her show how “unreasonable” you are and that could act as a wake up call to your siblings. Just give wtv amount u feel comfortable with.

Edit: just to add. Asian culture is just different compared to the west. We do emphasize on filial piety but we arent shunned when we are staying with parents during adulthood cz it is normalised here. Like in the US once they reach adulthood, they are expected to look for their own place to stay. Their rent and mortgage interest are insanely high too. Filial piety also prevents other issues too like homelessness and over reliance of elderly care facilities. From how i see it, it is supposed to just assist rather than fully cover their living expenses. || This post will go hairy depending on the reader’s age group. I am in my 30s as well and I agree with you, parents treating their children as an asset is a very twisted way of paradigm in this society. 

I am lucky enough for my parents to not have this mindset, however due to some financial issue in the family, I had been bearing some of the cost nevertheless. In my opinion, unless the person is working for you to generate income, people will always a liability in the long run.

A child is brought to life without consent, I don’t think we owe our parents, or my child owe me any pennies or favours, I treat the favour I did to my parents as a friend helping another friend. Enough ranting from my side too, good luck with your endeavour! || It takes one rotten apple to destroy a family. It happened in my family, hence why anyone that buat hal; drugs, knocked up etc will be swiftly cut away from the family. Their selfish desires will just have a ripple effect in a bad way. || Been here, my final act was actually cutting everyone off. Went NC for many years till now because its not my job to take care of everyone when i can barely take care of myself. Thats when my life flourished, got a better job, better life, etc. It might seem like anak derhaka but better to be derhaka than to think killing myself or my family all the time lol.

Hope you get thru this ✨️ || Good morning , || Hi OP, I'm also being used as a retirement fund and getting guilt-trip in every step i do. I don't have any advice to offer, but hearing your story gives me the courage to set boundaries so that I could, at least, live my life on my terms. Stay strong OP. Hope we can make it through this life and end this ""using kids as retirement fund"" shit. || Any value, it can become problematic when it's used to justify unreasonable sacrifices. We need to do it the modern way, the balanced version. Respect and care, yes but not blind obedience. || Yeah our society is toxic like that

Business trip to Cyberjaya,"I'm going on a 1-week business trip to Cyberjaya next month. While searching for hotels, I noticed that Putrajaya seems like a better place to base myself in and just take Grab going to Cyberjaya everyday. Is it easy to get Grab around this area? After office meetings, I'd love to explore local food  and I saw that Dorsett Hotel is located near a food truck park as well as Putrajaya Square. I would love to try authentic nasi lemak, roti and other Malaysian bread, and noodle dishes. (I'd welcome rest recommendations as well) this is my first time in Malaysia as well...

Why do I have higher Grab food delivery rates?,"Why am I seeing higher delivery fees than my friend’s? We are ordering from the same restaurant, we are at the same location (encircled 2.9km away), and we tried it at the same time (so demand/surge/whatever should be same). We both use android phones. We both do not have the Grab Unlimited subscription.

I already tried asking customer support about this, but first the chat was ended by the agent after reading my message, and second the ticket I raised has been stuck there waiting for a response for days already.

I just want to know the reason why.

Only differences between me and my friend that could affect this which I could think of are: 1) I am on the Gold tier while he is on the Member tier, 2) He is local Malaysian.","I remember seeing similar news in Singapore a few years ago and there was outrage about it in the Singapore subreddit, just putting my tinfoiled hat on but I think Grab's algorithm differentiates their users based on their spending habits and tiers, higher tiered users or frequent users are probably marked as less price sensitive so they will just mark up the price in hopes that you will stick on using their service and avoid considering alternatives || Did your friend have the annual subscription? || OP I recommend you to repost this to r/Bolehland as well. Try to retitle your post to include the fare difference since many commenters here did not read the description and misunderstood your post, I think about half of the commenters here just assumed that you were complaining about the expensive fees

Also if possible try to combine both images into one to show the price difference side by side to make it easy for people to see the price difference

The post about the price difference went viral in r/Singapore which prompted Grab to give a response 3 years ago, honestly I don't want Grab to get away with this || They charged you more so Tan Chong family get richer || Grab's magical algorithm is supposed to calculate delivery fees based on distance, availability of riders, the business of the restaurant and probably a few other factors I'm not aware of. How any average end user can tell if it's not also programmed for blatant profiteering, we'll probably never know, but I wouldn't put it past them given their history. || Grab Unlimited user here. Only RM5 a month, and 70% of my orders are free delivery most of the time, on top of the price cuts i get everytime i order from a store with Hot Deals tagged. I don't order that frequently, at most once to twice a week. 

As for food panda, haven't touched them in years. || It's all the algorithms, it's not some conspiracy theory. The calculation is based on time, availability of drivers, weather, traffic.. Basically a multitude of data points that change by the minute and effect the calculation... || Same here. I have two grab accounts, the one I often use has Gold tier, the other is just left at home for family members to use. The one with Gold usually shows a slightly higher fee during peak hours. The algorithm probably assumes a frequent user would be willing to overlook a higher fee. Same thing with Foodpanda. || For agoda, i notice constant price difference between my android phone and my wife's iPhone, with the iphone always cheaper.

Not sure phone brand related or because i always book with the wife's phone || I have a similar experience as well with Grab Food and Shopee Food. Same location, restaurant, food, placing the order at the same time, everything is the same including user tier but different delivery fee rates.

Food delivery peak during the pandemic, investors threw money at these businesses. Now, online food delivery stagnated, and some are on a decline. Most of them are bleeding cash. The only reason Grab is dominant is due to their other services supporting their food delivery service. || Got lah. Foodpanda service is actually much faster. Grab is slow as fark. Usually 1 hr delivery. But Shopee Food delivery mainly gone. Because shopee service sucks, if your food is gone...good luck...wait ding dong email for a few weeks.

Foodpanda still has best service with contactable live agents who take action immediately.

What kind of scam is this?,"Today me and my friend were waiting near Jalan P Ramleela for our grab around 11.45 pm at night and suddenly a woman in hijab with her girl child (must be 5 yo) came to us and told us to book grab for her in broken english. She looked decent and was having a bag of Mcdonalds food. We said we don't have that app in our phone, then she suddenly left her child at the stop and crossed the road, the poor child had to carry the bag and cross the road all by herself to the other end. This lady is then asking other western tourists to book her taxi or something, nobody bothered to help. We felt sorry for the poor child, but may I know if this is a scam or was the lady genuinely trying to get some help?","Sorry, am not in Malaysia anymore but this sounds a bit like members of the Rohingya groups who used to beg in the area (and probably still do). Always trying something or other. Although it sounds really harsh, it's best to just ignore them - unless the child is in immediate danger (or abandoned) in which case there are police around the KLCC towers whom you could at least alert/hand the child off to. || It's a scam by Grab to get you to download the app || We also dont know || Genuinely speaking, would a mother leave her child to cross the road alone? || The kind of scam that gets you to lower your guard because they have a kid with them. || U know the best since u are the one and people around there at that exact moment experience it first hand and in front of your eyes.

"Grab's services contributed RM9.9 billion to Malaysia's economy in 2023, about 0.5% of the country's GDP",,"Such a depressing state of affairs. Our transit landscape is so fucked up that a company centralised a taxi service, making enough money to branch off to start a digital bank. Meanwhile the gig workers who keep the company afloat earn pennies while they drive around for hours to scrape by. || While Grab's service may increased economic activity but it doesn't generate new wealth nor the wealth stayed within Malaysia.

It is a capital flight where the profit is an existing wealth outflow out of the country.

Unless we continuously generating new wealth to counter the outflow, all may be well.

I never used Grab or other similar services, but it seems these companies are changing gears to earn profit and reduced workers' compensation, at the same time the demand is reduced relative to the pandemic.

It also created a culture of delivery riders impervious to traffic law, and being a menace to other road users.

Everything have a cost. || Grab is a parasite where delivery guys are underpaid, restaurants have to overcharge, and Grab gets all the money in between. They don't provide actual value.

The infographic says Grab contributed 9.9b. I say Grab consumed 9.9b. || In defense of grab, shopeefood and foodpanda, I believe they've given many young folks who struggle to hold down regular jobs something that resembles a job. They make a somewhat livable sum of money (i heard they make like 2-4k a month), and that allowed many of them to avoid a life of crime. I actually believe the presence of these grabs helped to reduce crime throughout the country, and for that reason alone I wish they remain around. 

Grab is also historically unprofitable ( i recall they are still lossmaking? They are hoping the gxbank is the one that makes money to subsidize the rest of the co). So, I actually don't begrudge khazanah for not investing. 

Look at Grab's post listing share price. from $10 now only $5. 50% down. || Now calculate how much net profit they made || Inb4 - tapi rider majority orang kita. || And to think about it, Khazanah kicked them out of investment stages that they went to Singapore's branch of investment and secured it there. We lost a literal unicorn in investment bbecause Khazanah thought we can make our own SHEIN. || A selfish business strategy you may say, but its an effective and probably efficient business strategy rather than previous infrastructure (ie public taxi) where uncertainty and untruthful plague it pre-Grab era.

I rather use a selfish business where I know the price and the direction rather than a business that have no idea where they are going and charge inconsistently, up and down like a roller coaster. || How does it not generate new wealth when it created an additional opportunity for people to earn money with their vehicles? How does it not generate new wealth when it opened up market for even roadside stalls to customers that may had not been aware of them all this while?

If Grab was paying crazy dividends, then I'd agree that Grab is only taking money out of the country. But seeing that they're only barely reported a profit last year and just recently had positive cash flow, that doesn't seem quite right.

Bro, not all companies outside of Malaysia are ""bad"" per se. If all ""foreign"" companies are only deemed as leeches who are draining our cash, then we would've been stuck in pre-independence era. || I’m not defending Grab but isn’t the whole point of Grab is that business doesn’t have to build their own delivery/online platform?",17/2/2025,69,33,1739801016,malaysia,grab food,https://i.redd.it/jnlwwltnhpje1.jpeg
Calling out businesses using AI images on GrabFood,"Can't ya'll just take proper real life photos rather than this monstrosity? dahla caj mahal pastu malas nak ambik proper food photos.
","Can be considered false advertising. ""For illustration purpose only"" can only go so far. Can we report a store for false advertising? (I don't use Grab so IDK the features) || The sad thing is, I think most of older people might not even realize it was an AI picture. Heck I just show this picture to my friend (late 20s) and she thought it's a real picture. || If a restaurant doesn't bother putting actual effort into advertising their food, can you trust them to put actual effort into making their food? || This so sohai, taking ""the picture is only for illustration purposes"" to the next level. || This is literally false advertising that is clearly designed to misleading customers.

Taking food photos isn't that hard, even smartphone photos can get the job done. Anything that isn't fake AI crap will work better.

This kind of laziness is why we can't have nice things. If there is one type of photography that cannot be replaced with AI, its product photography. || Agree. Of course la AI gonna look good and shi but I wanna know how my food looks like before I order it. Not gonna expect it looks 100% like the photo but atleast it's real photo. || Thank you for sharing. I'll boycott this kind of business. Using AI picture of products = couldn't be bothered about their products. If they are not bothered about what they sell, why should I? || I ordered from this place (not using AI photos) that showed dumplings fried or rather grilled the proper ""pot-sticker"" way.. .. when the food arrived it looked like someone used their hands to squeeze the dumpling smaller than threw it into a deep fryer.. thing was like hard and dry..

Malaysian InDrive Driver Scams,"I’m a tourist in Malaysia and I tried using InDrive app yesterday going to concert venue. Since Grab is taking a while to find me a driver. I was able to book In-Drive instead. This particular driver has negotiated a price but considering he has better ratings, I accepted the ride for RM16. 

My mode payment selected is cash since I don’t have Touch N Go and Malaysian e-wallets. And then when he was dropping me off and I paid him RM50. He says he he doesn’t have any spare change? I don’t have exact amount because I’ve used my small bills already earlier when I purchased some food. I only have 158 bills on hand. 

The guards on the concert venue is telling him to hurry up to avoid causing any traffic and since vendors nearby don’t have any change too. In the end, I did not receive my change of RM34. 

I just felt like this action of the driver is kinda bit like a scam. They can’t expect everyone especially tourist to have Malaysian e-wallets. Has anyone experienced this? ","It's not a scam. But using InDriver has its downsides as you can see here. Not every driver may have the exact change all the time. He should have been more prepared though.

You will actually get very similar things happening in countries like China where many will ask for exact cash notes because they don't keep any change. || It's unlikely to be a scam, it's quite rare these days to carry 
 change for a 50 as everyone uses digital wallets and bank apps now.

If you don't want to encounter this again you can choose the more expensive options on grab to get a ride or use AirAsia Move or the Bolt apps. Both those apps have a credit card payment option.

Indriver is not very tourist friendly at the current time unless you have exact change in cash. || Been scolded by e-hailing drivers for many years for using cash. All the drivers always told me to use cashless payment. I give in eventually. Worst case if you select to pay with cash in the app not a single driver will accept your order. I’m guessing that what happened when you tried using Grab.  || You have no idea it's your fault? Some people are so entitled. Try that on buses. You know, that big long thing where people always pay with small change. Where does all those small changes goes when you give the driver big notes? I am sure it still in the box where the driver should have key to it. Even vending machine don't give change anymore. || That's on you bro || Idk why locals here are saying it’s not a scam and almost victim blaming, as a local I want to apologize. Yeah it’s not a scam, but atleast make an effort to pay back some change. RM34 change, not a RM5 change for f sake. OP already tried calling and they won’t pick up, they don’t want to give the change back.

I as a female also heard some harassment stories on InDrive before on reddit and mentioned I would never use Indrive, thankfully till today not. When I mentioned that on this sub somewhere in comments I suddenly got downvotes. Just ignore these stupid redditors, and stick with Grab or just have exact change next time. || Even on grab, I had many cases where the drivers didn’t have change for RM50. It’s not a scam, it’s just that nobody uses cash anymore || Buncha comments here saying driver is not at fault for not carrying change but if the driver not returning calls/messages and not interested to transfer the change digitally, then the driver is at fault. || Duitnow got ASEAN bank user QR scan nowdays.

Wonderful experience visiting Malaysia 🫶,"I recently visited Malaysia for 9 days with my friend (both late 20s women from India), travelling across Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Langkawi and Melaka. We had such a lovely time there - the locals were very sweet and helpful, the food and drinks were pretty affordable, and most of all, the country is so beautiful. The highlight of my trip was witnessing a magical sunset at Pantai Tengah. 

Also, I must add, taking domestic flights was so hassle-free — it took us barely 15 minutes from entry to boarding gates, something which takes nearly 4x more time in India. 

As two young women, I was a bit worried about our safety in beach towns but it was a largely safe experience in the country. Just one time we were unfortunate to face an awful Grab experience where the driver left us stranded in Melaka but another driver, an elderly man, offered to drive us back to KL and ensured we reached safely. 

Overall, looking back, I’m glad we took this trip! It was kinda tiring but worth it as we managed to visit a bunch of places. 

Things/spots I loved in 🇲🇾: 

1. Joloko in Kuala Lumpur 
2. Laksalicious in Penang 
3. Guinness 😭 (I don’t find it in India) 
4. Milo chocolates 
5. Nasi Lemak (of course!) ","Wow what a nice and caring uncle that drove you guys back to KL. Fuck that Grab driver that left you stranded. || Glad you enjoyed your experience in Malaysia. Hope you reported the Grab driver immediately. || Wholesome!!

A good trip report spreading positivity.

Thank you. || Did you visit Batu Caves in KL? It's really beautiful || Hi OP, I will be going in March in these places.
 did you take all domestic flights or some ferry/train/bus also? || Curious, why is there no Guinness in India ? || Absolutely! The Grab driver seemed very weird from the beginning and I wish I trusted my instinct early on. He drove for about 45 minutes before saying he can’t complete our ride because we won’t pay RM 400ish in cash — which we made it clear from the beginning. What a jerk. It was quite terrifying to be left in the middle of nowhere at 7pm but the next driver, an elderly Chinese man, agreed to drive us to KL although I’d called for him for a nearby drop-off. 

It was raining, there was a bad accident on the highway which led to congestion and it took us about four hours to reach, but at no point he complained. Even waited a few extra minutes at the end as we needed to find an ATM to withdraw cash. What a warm, helpful uncle. Reassured us that good people exist ❤️ || Yes, we did as soon as we got off the car. Grab said they’d take action (without giving further detail though). || I’d love to be back soon! ❤️ || No, we didn’t. We planned to visit it after flying back to KL from Langkawi but our flight was delayed that afternoon and later it began raining so we couldn’t manage it. In hindsight I wish we visited Batu Caves instead of a day trip to Melaka because it was underwhelming and the journey was not worth it.

Travelling to Kuala and langkawi,"I'm travelling to Kuala drom india for 3 days and langkawi for 3 days in February with my husband. 
I've been travelling to travel agents as I'm not completely sure about travel and tickets and currency there. 
So if anyone can clarify or help me with these doubts?
1. What are the beautiful places to visit in 3 days in kuala and 3 days and langkawi .
2. If I get down from kuala airport, do i get taxis to travel and also is there a concept of day packages within kuala where we can book drivers for the day tours.
3. Above is if we cannot get rides easily. I mean I heard grab works but when I install it doesn't show both kuala and langkawi. I'm afraid if I would end up in a situation where we cannot get transport, especially in langkawi.
4. I know that rupees definitely won't work, should I get money exchanges in dollars or ringgit? And is it safe to cary cash?
5. Do credit cards work.? Atleat for online apps?
6. How to book tickets for places like k l towers, the skydeck dinner and other places. 
7. Any tickets we need to book in advance.
8. Any must have food options and must visit places. Currently considering kl towers, genting highlands and putrajaya. Langkawi island hopping and village tour.


Thanks in advance. ","By Kuala, do you mean Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Capital?

For Kuala Lumpur, there're the Petronas Twin Tower & its Suria KLCC, KLCC Aquaria, KLCC Park, Central Market (Pasar Seni), Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, Food haven in Alor Street, the China Town, Batu Caves, etc.

It depends on your preference.

For Langkawi, there're the Cenang Beach, Underwater World, Langkawi Sky Bridge & Cable Car, Dataran Lang, Kilim Karst Geoforest Park, Wildlife Park & Bird Paradise, etc.

If you plan well, you might be able to squeeze most of them within 3 days. || 1. Get your KL Hop On Hop Off bus passes from Klook. They cover almost everything by bus. Best part you can get down at any spot and onboard and next bus which is normally in 15 mins. They have two routes. Each route takes a whole day (until 4pm) 

They also have exclusive night bus for people who love night experience for the same journey.

2. Grab works but be mindful that taxis in Malaysia work on a capacity basis unlike India. They count passenger+ bags. If you are 2 people with 2 bags then it's a sedan. But if it's 2 people and 3 bags. You need a SUV. Sedan will show up. See your bags and cancel on you.

3. Grab again. Works flawlessly. Also many grab drivers can be approached for a private hire for a day. Normally hotels also have tie ups with cabbies for fixed charges. 

4. Ringgits. Carry small change it'll help for negotiations (We Indians love that :D)

5. Yes but at POS online. Online transaction can be hard. Get Ixigo or Niyo Forex Card for 0 forex charges and 0 currency conversion. Rest all CC charge you 2/3%

6. Klook

I just got back in Oct so if you need any more queries, feel free to ask. || Thanks, does grab work in langkawi as well. || Thanks a lot, was chatting with a travel agent and i felt that they are quiting around 80k for 6 days Excluding flights covering 
Kl towers, Batu caves, genting highlands and langkwai island hopping and village tour(this I'm unaware what these are exactly). 
Also how do you pay via grab.?
Have you also visited langwaki? || ya. of course. || It was monsoon and most of the water activities were shut so I had to skip Langkawi and head to Singapore instead. My entire trip including visa for Singapore cost me 1L /pp for 9 days. Stays meals transfer included. Batu Caves and KL towers are only transport fares. Genting too since it's a hill top. Monsoon ruined that for me as well. || Is flight the only way recommended to reach langkawi from KL? || Oh i didn't know that, i had tickets booked to langkawi hope water activities to be open by then. || Yes. Flight is the most direct.

If you wanna take ferry, you have to board it from Penang or Kedah. And I wouldn't recommend it, 'cos it's quite bumpy. You might get seasick halfway there. || Can I dm you for queries?

"Grab/ShopeeFood riders of reddit, what were your weirdest interactions with people while delivering food?",,"Not me. But just last week, my brother sent me a call recording of him receiving a call from a customer—asking if my brother wanted a BJ or not.

It's safe to say my brother vows to stop doing this gig once his marriage fund is 100% funded. He's at 90% currently. || Grab food experience: The customer put the wrong address in and started spam-calling me after I redelivered the food saying she wanted to get the police to kill me. Real crazy stuff that day.

Grab Car experience: The customer placed the wrong address and ended up wasting 3 hrs at the police station after she threatened to accuse me of kidnapping and Sexual Assault. Good thing I have a dash cam. Certainly helps me when she insulted the police during the visit. Woman has issues for sure, thinking her part Aussie ass means she could get everything she wanted. || I heard some like to be naked on door waiting for delivery and tease you guys. Anybody encountered this before? Need story from both side. || Gay customer wanna flirt with me sorry la i prefer original honey || Grabcar here. Got one japanese lady shouted that I'm kidnapping her once I accidentally took a wrong turn. I immediately stopped the car in the middle of the road and asked her to get out. All this happened in mont Kiara where there's at least 1000 people out there strolling about.

Called grab support and they also confused why she blamed me of kidnapping her in one of the busiest street. Crazy lady.

From that moment itself I installed internal dashcam with voice recording to defend myself against crazy passengers. || in shopee there is chat for rider. there is also one from restaurant. but the later one is greyed out. so use the rider chat inform which curry and piece to get, to that one guy said nothing to do with him, tell restaurant direct (how?). so you ride there cant tell the restaurant the customer asked for what? very poor customer service.

so a few things can happen. they ignore your request and just do whatever; or they actually do what is asked; or they just straight out say no. lelz...

driver got me curry lentil and fish. the ones people most often don't like x-x; 

someone needs to remind driver, without customer u have no job. so don't behave like this :/ || just hope this won’t happen in MY

Grab unlimited free delivery not working ,"Hello, I’m visiting Malaysia and downloaded the Grab app for rides and food. I got Grab unlimited free trial and the tourist pack but the free delivery does not add on and all the offers (like 30% off specific stores) does not work. Is this an issue others face too? ","I'm not sure abt the tourist pack. But Grab has imposed more T&C to enjoy their 'discounts'. Did you order above a min amount and at the right time? Cuz during peak hours, they can decide not to offer free delivery. 

Even the free delivery only applies to selects stores 🤡 || I'm on Grab Unlimited too, and there's fine print which applies. 

It's not free delivery, but an RM3 discount on delivery fees for orders totalling RM20 and above. Also the 35% Grab Unlimited discount only applies for restaurants labelled Hotdeals.

Looks like you did get the RM3 discount on delivery above, as there's no way Saver is only RM0.50. || There’s all sorts of inconsistent rubbish on grab. Huge discounts that are capped at only a few RM etc etc… just marketing to people who don’t check and now they more or less have a monopoly || Grab apparently saving you from diabetes || Did you ever resolve this? I’m having the same issue now.

Never encountered before during previous subscription. Double checked with a family member and theirs have the RM3 off from grabunlimited while mine does not. || That is so odd, I’m not use to it being like that in my home country. Thank you for letting me know || Ohhh so the  0.50 is with the RM 3 off? That makes sense it just doesn’t display it thanks. I don’t know why offers like buy one get one 50% off or other store specific offers does not apply though. I add to cart, it says discount applied then it says offer not available. || I wasn’t going to actually order the boba haha, just the top seller item so I can show the discount does not apply || I ended up messaging them about it after I gave in and placed an order and then it got sorted out after that. Maybe give their customer service a message? || where did you message them? They dont have a proper customer service platform.

So you placed an order first and later got refunded the delivery fee?",19/1/2025,6,10,1737262433,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4qr44

GRAB getting worse ☹️,"I have been using Grab for YEARS but recently,Ithe service has gone from bad to worse..Delivery charges are ridiculous..Drivers now accept ONLY if ride faress are high..Then they cancel 🙄..Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded..Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours..Food & mart prices are higher than outside market prices..And the choices are so limited..Some drivers are RUDE..It's come to the point,I avoid Grab as much as possible..Also,they accept the rides,then DON'T move till i get so fed up,I cancel 🤬","You can read up on “platform decay” or Enshittification. What you’re describing is baked into the business model - they were never sustainable at low cost, good quality service.

For what it’s worth, I now only use foodpanda for food delivery and take airport limo from airport but for the most part we’re stuck with a monopoly. || I really hate drivers trying to make us cancel instead of them cancelling. They just hang around and not moving. I was not giving up, I used another phone to book a ride, let the first driver wait 2 hours before telling them they lost 2 hours of their lives waiting for me to cancel || BOLT BOLT BOLT, all the older and smarter drivers have switched to Bolt/indrive/maxim. || A few days ago, the fare for pickup from my house was RM60+ and rising. Then I changed the pickup location to the opposite street, my neighbour's, and the fare dropped to RM30+. 

THEIR ALGORITHM PURPOSELY PUT HIGHER PRICE IF PICKUP FROM HOME! || Just look up the distance between your location and your destination, deduct 20% from your total fare and divide it by the KM. That's how much the driver gets per KM. If it's less than RM0.90 - RM1/KM, be prepared to encounter problem like getting stood up. 

Based on my own experience as a part time driver, out of 30 jobs,maybe only 2 or 3 i got RM1 or more/KM. On average it's RM0.70/KM sometimes even RM0.60/KM. That's the reason the service is getting worse. It's proportionate to the price which is super cheap. If you choose Grabcar Plus, it's very rare for this to happen if any because of the higher price. || So far I have good experience for Grab Food but I guess I live in an area where there are a lot of delivery riders. I order a lot of Grab food a month (circa RM700-800) as I get some sort of allowance from company (due to remote work). 

When it comes to Grab ride, sometimes I can see that it is a few drivers which tends to spoil the whole bunch. They started behaving exactly like how taxi drivers were hated upon in the past. They basically became numb to their customers. From driving like hooligans and maniacs to simply blocking traffic and stopping indiscriminately just to drop off a passenger. || I think ppl talked about how Grab started the way they did because of their massive funding, right at the beginning.

Get ppl hooked in their services, by sustaining massive losses.

Now they're just trying to break even. Don't think they're profitable even?

The business model was never a viable one. || They had to start making money 1 day ... can't be making losses forever. || For food I completely agree it has been nothing but downhill. I don't use grab car so can't comment... for airport runs, use the train it comfortable and fast. Around town using mrt. || I *just* started to drive for Grab. I don't think I can turn-off auto-accept, although I don't cancel on anyone (when I get tired, I just go offline and finish my current job).

> Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded

I mean... that's fair, isn't it? 

> Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours

Really?

I never see these ""triple"" fares. I would **love** to get some of that.",30/12/2024,374,80,1735531786,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1hpendm/grab_getting_worse/
Is this happening to Malaysia lately alry?,,"We have tipping in Malaysia, but it's not the **American** version. You give if you want to, not because some bullshit ""oh no the workers can't afford to live otherwise, so it's mandatory kinda sorta"" abomination.

I would tip if it was raining, or if the delivery is to my current home (the road to my taman is very long, so I feel bad for any riders coming here). || I’d probably be more inclined to tip if they don’t prompt me to with “remainder” || There is a difference.

Malaysia: Tip because we feel satisfied with service

Americans: Tip or NO FOOD!

Edit: removed adjective || For me lah, if someone asked for it, I won't give. Gives me the ick. Polite or not polite, I feel like someone shouldn't ask for extra reward for doing their job. If however, the service is really exemplary, no need to ask one, I'll give it as appreciation. || Sorry, tips are given voluntarily and for good service, not when asked. If I'm about to give a tip and I got asked first, sorry, you're not getting any.

I typically give when riders deliver in the rain. || Unlike in the US, tipping here is **NOT** mandatory — and you knew that, didn’t you? 

Some people like spreading a little happiness and kindness, especially when their food arrives quickly. And when it’s late? Spoiler alert: it’s usually not the rider’s fault. 

Me? I toss my Domino’s guy RM1 or RM2, depending on the change I’ve got, and it makes his day because he wasn’t expecting it. Don’t feel like tipping? Fine. No one’s forcing you. Live your life. || Tf is that english || I once tipped generously rm20 because it was an urgent delivery (visa related) that had to be done on the same day, was a lalamove parcel delivery by motorbike and I was happy to make his day because he really made mine || I don't tip. || Don't think that message is from GRAB. Because the icon is different. Seems like the rider emulate a message like it is from the GRAB system to persuade you to tip him. I may be mistaken, i rarely order from GRAB. But the typo is a give away.",23/12/2024,375,160,1734947743,malaysia,grab food,https://i.redd.it/7hajgp1emk8e1.jpeg
"14-Day Malaysia Itinerary - Feedback Needed
","My girlfriend and I are visiting Malaysia for 14 days in mid-January, and I’d love some feedback on our planned itinerary. I don’t want to micromanage every hour, but I like having a general plan to make sure we can fit everything in. I’m hoping the r/Malaysia community can share their thoughts, what do you think of our plan?



Our Itinerary:

Day 1: Arrive in Kuala Lumpur at 3:45 PM. Plan to reach our hotel, check in, grab some food, and rest.

Day 2: Free day to explore KL—thinking of a food tour, visiting museums, seeing KLCC , and going with the flow.

Day 3: Either visit Batu Caves and explore more of KL OR do a day trip to Melaka.

Day 4: Travel to Taman Negara.

Day 5: Hiking, exploring TN

Day 6: Hiking, exploring TN

Day 7: Travel to Cameron Highlands—partly by boat (is this recommended?).

Day 8: Spend a full day exploring Cameron Highlands. (Thinking about swapping this around with Taman Negara, since this would mean we would be in CH on the weekends of which I read that it is not advised)

Day 9: Travel to Penang and spend the evening there.

Day 10: Explore Georgetown and other sights in Penang.

Day 11: Travel to Langkawi.

Day 12: Spend the day exploring Langkawi.

Day 13: Morning in Langkawi, then fly back to KL.

Day 14: Final day in KL—maybe visit Batu Caves if skipped earlier. Flight departs late evening.



What I’m Looking For:

Are there any spots on this route you’d recommend skipping or replacing?

Should we spend more (or less) time in certain places?

Are there alternative destinations worth considering (e.g., Ipoh)?

Any tips for getting between locations or things to do at these stops?

thoughts and advice on potential start-up?,"A group of friends and I have plans to launch a start-up but want to get some thoughts on our idea. We took a group of tourists on a tour recently and observed that a lot of them wanted to try authentic local cuisine/ate ""bad"" local food that isn't representative of our culinary culture at all, so we wanted to start a platform to provide tourists with truly authentic local food cooked by regular locals themselves. If this idea progresses, we plan on launching in both Singapore and Malaysia.

Idea: 
- Locals who are willing to cook can invite tourists to have a meal in their homes or let tourists pick up the cooked food at a location of their choice.
            - eg. empty nesters who want to cook         for people, retired elderly folks who enjoy cooking and are bored/want extra income, people who can cook and have difficulty finding jobs 

- Tourists who want to try genuine home cooked food (the most authentic a local experience can get) and/or want to connect with locals 

- model similar to grab and Airbnb, locals only accept tourists if they want to, flexible system

Pain points in other options:

- restaurants in areas where tourists tend to stay are more expensive and tend to change the recipes to appeal more to tourists, making food less authentic 
- authentic hidden gems are hidden for a reason, locals often hide them to prevent them from becoming crowded, and they generally don't get a lot of coverage so tourists don't know about them

Potential issues:

1. Security

- we were thinking of using Airbnb's verification system, I.e the local will put pictures of where they'll be hosting the tourists, food they've cooked before and maybe pics of their cooking process, use reviews and ratings as the primary check and balance

- the platform acts as a middle-man like Grab or Airbnb, so it isn't directly responsible for bad experiences 

- will also include options for the locals and tourists to set their preferences, eg. a local can choose not to dine with the tourist and can arrange for the tourist to pick up the food from a  terrain location 

2. Market 

- may be a niche market (haven't done interviews or anything yet so still just an assumption)

- a lot of Airbnb's success is attributed to tourists wanting a homey, culturally immersive feel to their stay so our platform would be recreating that, but for food

An international student intake about Malaysian food in Cyberjaya ,"Hi guys, I am an international student in Cyberjaya but never actually tried ""authentic Malaysian food"" and this actually makes me feel a little sad as I am not getting the full experience of living here.
Sure thing I go to the MAMAK, grab a plate and put some rice with ""sauce"" and maybe a chicken piece. It tastes really good but I don't actually think this is all of it to Malaysian food, especially for how Malaysia is known of the viraty of good food. ( I don't have problems with rice, what I am saying is I am just putting rice and one type of spicy sauce above it) 
What are the things that I should try ? Give me some dish names and where possibly I can eat them ( Halal please 😆)

Also, I am still not used to sweet food so I would prefer normal/spicy food.

Oh last thing. where does Mamaks stands when talking about Malaysian food, can I consider them ""authentic"" or modified for the taste of foreigners","Mamaks stand firmly in the quick, cheap(er) and convenient corner of Malaysian cuisine. || If you want to taste real Malaysian food, get out of the city and head out to the rural areas. Lots of restaurants or warungs by all different race selling good hearty delicious local food. For Malay food, just find one that sells rice with lots of different ""lauk"" (dishes). || May sound weird, but mamak / nasi kandar is a unique Malaysian experience. Would argued that, they serve Indian influenced local food.

You still can get nasi lemak, nasi goreng, mee goreng, etc. without an equivalent outside of Malaysia. Closest is probably Indonesia and India. || cyberjaya is mostly halal food. you need to get to Klang, PJ, KL for more rounded full experience of msian food || for cyberjaya, go to the food court at sports arena. There are local foods there. If you are into grilled fish, got stall called ""bumbung bakar"". Have a try || The thing is, I don't even order dishes in Mamak, I just grab a plate and put whatever I feel like it. ngl this is the most convenient way I ever had in ordering food.
But because I don't know dish names so I can't order them 😂
That's why I am feeling that I am not getting the full experience.
But thanks for letting me know, is there a dish/side dish I should try in Mamak ?
For example I tried Roti susu after a friend recommended it to me and I completely liked it || Thx for letting me know, I am a Muslim so I only eat Halal food, but you made me curious.
Is there really that much viraty of food here I am missing just because it doesn't contain alcohol or pork ? || Thank you, well definitely give it a shot 😁 || Try everything on the roti menu and find out your favourite. Everyone has their own favourite. 

My go to order in mamak are:

1. Roti Telur + Roti Planta, serve with dhal + sambal.

2. Martabak or roti sardin, if the place serve them good.

3. Maggi goreng + ayam goreng - hard to go wrong with this combo.

4. Cheese naan; or garlic butter cheese naan with tandoori chicken, if i feel luxurious.

5. Double thosai ghee or single thosai masala - usually difficult to get it right

Drinks depends on mood / weather but can't go wrong with teh o ais limau. Order teh tarik panas on rainy days.

I almost never grab anything on the counter.. but usually it has been sitting there for quite some time and pricey. Anything expensive on the menu is usually just a gimmick and you are better eating that elsewhere e.g. nasi / roti / whatever lambshank.

Bonus: Try order naan telur, if your mamak brother can make it happen for you, he's the man of man. || Oh definitely. Non Muslims make up 1/3 of the population and all have thier own dishes.

What to do if you got about 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur?,"Hi, doing visa run (sadly) tomorrow and was suggested I go to this airport.

I land 9AM and plane leaves 17PM ish, so I recon I have about 6 hours to do things.  
Any suggestions? If I can see 1 awesome thing or taste some good food I am happy.

A bit worried about taxi/transport tho, I got gojek/grab/bolt, but not sure what is mostly in use here?

Thanks for any input ❤️

PS! I totally regret not staying here longer....

EDIT: Thanks for feedback, leaving for plane in a few hours, will just stay at airport and lesson learned, if it happens again I will rather take a weekend off away :)","I assume you will be flying to KLIA/KLIA2. Six (6) hours is too short and costly for you to travel to Kuala Lumpur. You have to account for the time taken for you to actually reach the arrival gate, travel back and forth from KLIA/KLIA2 to Kuala Lumpur, immigration check, boarding, etc. 

I suggest the best you could experience is probably to take a Grab to [Mitsui Outlet Park](https://g.co/kgs/qCCfUFJ) for a stretch and if you are looking to have a taste of our local delicacy, you could try [Peranakan Place](https://www.peranakan.com.my/) or [Padi House](https://padihouse.com/) at Mitsui Outlet Park; not the best in town but it is probably the best option given the circumstances. || Take the KLIA Express train from the airport into the city. This will skip any road traffic and make the most use of your time. The train should be about 30 minutes from the airport to the KL Sentral station. From there, you can take the LRT or MRT to most attractions in the city. 

If you've never been to Kuala Lumpur before and want to see the twin towers, take the LRT from KL Sentral to KLCC station. 

For something nearer to the KL Sentral station, take the LRT to Pasar Seni station which is a local handicrafts market. You'll find plenty of restaurants within waking distance and Petaling Street nearby for food/shopping and if you like to look around for some street art.

Only pick one of these though, you don't have a lot of time with 6 hours. || No way. 6 hours too short. || just today, I went to KL. Just had to do 1 thing, and its settled in just 1 hour so I had nothing else to do the whole day. 

Before going to KL, I already bought the rapid kl daily city pass thing for RM6. So, I went to the museum. Then I wanted to go to the planetarium, but it was closed today. So, I went to bukit bintang for lunch. Jalan2 a bit there take photos. Then I went to trx. Had coffee at 1 of the cafes, and then went back before the rush hour started.

I used mrt for the whole trip and it cost rm6 only. wahahaha || For transport just use Grab since its mostly used by locals here & has a good price range for any route. (price increases during peak hours though) || Commonly we use grab here. 

If you’re looking for pub and all, there’s a street call Changkat which is located at the centre of the planet of the apes, bukit bintang. 

If you wanna try some local foods and all, go to kampung baru.  || 6 hours is too short. Getting out from immigration may take you an hour, getting to KL city takes at least another hour. That's 2 hours gone. If your plane leaves 5pm, that means you need to be at the airport at least at 3pm. Getting from KL to KLIA would take another 1-2 hours. That gives you around 2-3 hours to do things. || Take Grab and go to Putrajaya to bask in the view, eat and go back. Kuala Lumpur would be too risky. || Go Petalling Street and try some local food. || eat eat and eat",16/12/2024,9,19,1734364134,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1hfm1oo/what_to_do_if_you_got_about_6_hours_in_kuala/
Our family loved Malaysia,"This is a follow up to my earlier post where I asked whether we should skip Penang or Langkawi.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1fudq44/should\_we\_omit\_penange\_or\_langkawi\_from\_our\_trip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1fudq44/should_we_omit_penange_or_langkawi_from_our_trip/)

A lot of nice people suggested we go to Penang instead of Langkawi and we ended up following their advice. I am so so glad we did and we absolutely loved everything about not just Penang, but Malaysia in general.

As I posted earlier, my wife was unwell and hence we could not engage in physically challenging activities like theme parks. We loved just strolling around GeorgeTown and visiting different restaurants in KL. Our daughter loves Korean food and we ended up visiting different Korean restaurants both in Penang and KL and  the food was amazing. We loved the shopping, the street food, the mosques and how nice everyone we talked to were. One particular service staff in our KL hotel who was an elderly Malay guy was so very nice and gave us many tips on places to visit. It was a shame I didn't have enough time to see everywhere he recommended. Even a grab driver once recommended us a place to eat versus where we were headed which wasn't so nice.

I rented a self drive car in Penang and while I read on this subreddit how bad Penang drivers are, coming from my city in India, it was a breeze and a pleasure to drive there. We took the metro several times in KL and wherever we wanted to go, there was a station nearby.

And I must mention Durian! Ah well, please don't dislike me but we just couldn't get used to the smell of Durian. :) My wife had a  health issue due to which she felt nauseous often and the smell of Durian tortured her! :D :D

So I would just like to say that you have a beautiful country with infrastructure and services which just work. I have been reading this subreddit for several weeks now and I sense that sometimes people are not happy with what they have. But take it from an outsider that you have a beautiful country and amazing people and perhaps one of the nicest places to live in the world. I have been to the west, middle east, Australia and the vibes in Malaysia were perhaps the nicest anywhere! Thank you everyone. :)","You gotta level up your durian skill ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy)

Glad you had wonderful time here!

Also, those who can drive in India can survive anywhere and Penang drivers are nothing compared to what you guys have in India hahaha || hahah...msian drivers are bad in relation to developed western nations. if you came from india, you can def survive msian traffic. 

Many msians also detest durians, its not a universally liked thing.

Travel Guide: Genting Highlands ,"
Hi there! Genting Highlands is a hill station in Malaysia turned into Casino-Theme Park resort with one of the highest Gandola Cable Cars in Asia. Weather is cozy here compared to rest of Malaysian Peninsula. The most convenient route to the Genting Highlands is taking a bus from the KL Sentral, a bus station in near Kuala Lumpur. Not to mention, from the bus station in the Genting Highlands, you will take a cable car ticket taking you to the Chinswee Temple, a Buddhist temple. From there, you will take another cable car, which takes you up these hills to the Casino/Theme Park.


The cable cars have glass floor meaning it will make you feel like you are floating in the air; it's a bit scary though. The cable car ""does not stop"" so u have to jump out of it when you reach the resort. My cable car ""stopped"" in the middle of the track for like one minute. It was the most tensed minute of my life seeing myself stuck in the middle of the clouds thousands of meters above the ground. Later, it was clarified by the staff that it happened because one of the passengers at the drop off was elderly and unable to get off the cable car in time so they had to stop the entire line


Apart from the cable car experience, the theme park has many fun activities for the kids (im not a kid anymore haha). I didn't go casino because I'm already broke. Anyway, you will find McDonald's, KFC, and any western food chain here at ease despite Genting being predominantly Chinse I missed my bus OTW back to KL from Genting and had to book an expensive GRAB ride. Make sure you reach the bus terminal on time because it will take multiple cable cars going ""back"" from the resort(s) to the bus station here at Genting. Stay tuned for more","Unpopular opinion: Genting Highland (GH) is just another KL mall. Indoor everything, the map is confusing (i swear to God, there are djinss up there making us confuse like in Ikea so that we can spend more money), I would love to hear the late Lim Goh Tong’s opinions on GH’s directions now compare to say 20 years ago. 

Minus casino, I dont know why people are so obsessed going to GH, maybe that just me being old you lost interest in stuff. But the riding to Genting Highland thru the twisting roads with cold air blowing on your face is so much fun especially with high torque big clutched bike. || I agree. When you are on the road to genting and the sound your cars' tyres make, it's just so daring yet excited to hear. I also felt pressure on my ears when I was on a grab ride to the bus station in genting.

Staying in Bayan Lepas for 2 weeks. Travel and food tips appreciated! :),"Hi there - I will be staying in Bayan Lepas this coming November for work. I am not from Malaysia and this will be my first time in Bayan Lepas and George Town.

Would like to ask the following:
1) What would be the best ways to commute from Bayan Lepas to George Town aside from Grab? I do not drive so commuting is the only option for me.

2) What would be your recommended food spots in Bayan Lepas? I am non-Muslim and don't have any food allergies as well, so open to any great recommendations.

3) What are your favorite hangout spots in Bayan Lepas / George Town?

Thank you so much in advance 🙌🏾 ❤️","Hello fellow pinoy


1. There are Rapid Penang buses. Use Google maps to find out which buses to take. Prepare coins because they don't have change.

2. Bayan Lepas is big. I can't advice but usually there are a lot of restaurants within walking distance.
3. There's the snake temple in Bayan Lepas. Queensbay Mall is a big place to hangout. Go to Kek Lok Si temple. There are a lot of museums in Georgetown like Peranakan mansion. Walk around the heritage area like Armenian street. The CAT bus is free which goes around Georgetown. || Oh hey welcome to my neighbourhood!

Transport as shared in other comment Rapid Penang bus is practically the only public transport option in Penang other than e-hailing services.

For food you may try Pisa Corner Food Court for a variety of hawker food; if you like dim sum there's Maxim in Sungai Dua; Uncle Lanz nasi lemak is not bad (and there are some other food spots along the street that you may try); and Empat Sekawan for a nicer cafe option.

Queensbay Mall is probably the most popular entertainment and hangout spot in this part of the island, and you can also go to the recently opened Queen's Waterfront right next to it for some food and entertainment. || I live in Bukit Jambul which is also in Bayan Lepas (it's a huge area) So many pinoys here, mostly working as engineer in factories. Should get to know them first via tinder/grindr/IG etc before you arrived. || By the way, Penang Hill is a tourist trap in my opinion. Other places are more interesting and cheaper. || Maraming salamat for this really comprehensive and helpful info! ❤️ || Thank you so much for these recommendations, especially the ones on food 🤤

If I can follow up with one more q, what are your go-to places for char kway teow in Bayan Lepas and / or Georgetown? 😁 || Thanks for the tip! ❤️ || Ah unfortunately I'm probably the last person you should ask for CKT recommendations because I don't get to enjoy most CKTs due to some food allergies.

But if you're going in blind or without prior preferences, I don't think you'd go wrong with most online guides and recs. Even if people have their own opinions on the most popular ones I do think that all of them have their specialty, and you'll certainly find some that you'll enjoy. || Oh no, sorry to hear that but thank you still for giving your 2 cents.

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

"Kuala Lumpur Trip / Itineraries, Tips, Food & Must Dos!","Hi Guys, 

Here is a delayed write up from our 6 night stay in Kuala Lumpur (KL) in July last year. The temperatures were around 28 degrees Celsius and the City is a real mix of impressive skyscrapers that tower over streets lined full of colourful and vibrant street food outlets alongside lots of green spots and breathtaking nature just outside of the City!

KL is a fantastic hub for trips all over South East Asia and we were here only for a brief stay but most of the people we met were using KL as a base for their trip and planning their onward travel. 

Alongside lots of general walking around, eating and socialising we did two main day trips and an afternoon food tour during our 6 night stay in KL with the main highlights below.

# Accommodation and Transport

We stayed in the **JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur** located in the Bukit Bingtang area. We chose this hotel for the location being close to good food and bar spots with some ‘hustle and bustle’ city feel but not so close that it was too loud or chaotic. It is also close to all of the large and high end shopping centres if that takes your fancy. Overall the hotel was very convenient and was a perfect base for our day trips and excursions! 

**Public transport** in KL is mixed and it really depends on where you’re going as to whether it’s the best option - we got the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) train only once because taxi apps were very cheap. Uber has grown its presence massively in KL compared to when I was there years ago (it used to be just ‘Grab’) and we took Ubers as our main transport option. However like all large Cities traffic can be quite bad and so it depends. Locals told us the bus system isn’t the best due to a low frequency and reliability. 

# The best place we ate

We are big foodies and we were so excited to visit Malaysia for the wide variety of South Asian food and it did not disappoint. You must do your research though to find the hidden gems and avoid any upset stomachs. 

Our favourite place to eat was ‘**Village Park Nasi Lemak**’ and the Nasi Lemak was the best we’ve had - the rice was really fluffy but then also a bit creamy from the coconut and the chicken meat is juicy and succulent. The ayam goreng/ fried chicken was also very tasty and had good flavor. The restaurant is in the Damansara Utama and we took the easiest option and got an Uber there. It can get very busy and you can’t book so have that in mind but the food is really delicious! Full address and other food options at the end of the post!

Our favourite tour was the **Taman Negara National Park Day Tour from KL** which we did on our third day in KL. It's one of the oldest tropical rain-forests in the world and is a perfect day trip to get outdoors and experience Malaysian nature as well as having an element of adventure!

Highlights were **walking along the canopy walkway** (which can be a bit daunting but is a great experience), **meeting the native tribes and the boat ride through the rapids** - heads up you get soaked but it's very fun. Make sure you take insect repellent and good walking shoes though as there is a fair bit of walking and steps. The trip is also a full day with an early start but it's well worth it. A downside for us was the food provided was very average but we thought this would be the case and just took some extra snacks and made up for it with a big evening meal once the tour was over. Our guide called “Mushroom” and he was **super knowledgeable** about the forest and nature and he really adds to the experience.

# Some day trip inspiration

Here are some other day trips and excursions we did to get the most out of our brief trip.

# Street Food Tours

https://preview.redd.it/1g37eneigxcd1.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d5f5e2aaed1f27379b167195d7d43f0a1bdb0a7

We did a **guided food tour** on our second day and really recommend it for getting your bearings around KL and finding great local spots! The tour we did lasted 4 hours and included **15 tastings** which varied from savoury noodles, more Nasi lemak but also local fruits and desserts. We took the advice we read in reviews and arrived hungry and would recommend doing the same as you are very full by the time the tour ends! There weren’t many vegetarian options so I wouldn’t recommend this if you were vegetarian and definitely not for vegans but the guides do take a lot of consideration of dietary requirements and likes/dislikes. 

Our guide was called Sam and was **great fun and really knowledgeable** and took time to explain the stories and culture behind everything we ate. **All the places were top quality food and they’re smaller, family run local businesses who put real care and thought into the food.** Overall the tour is great for going to places you wouldn’t find without very extensive research or local knowledge and difficulty as some of the food outlets are a bit off the map and its a great way to get to know other travellers. 

**Kuala Lumpur: Street Food Tour with 15+ Tastings:** [https://www.getyourguide.com/kuala-lumpur-l171/kuala-lumpur-chef-led-small-group-food-tour-t203827/?partner\_id=XDCPBTG&utm\_medium=online\_publisher](https://www.getyourguide.com/kuala-lumpur-l171/kuala-lumpur-chef-led-small-group-food-tour-t203827/?partner_id=XDCPBTG&utm_medium=online_publisher)

We didn’t do this option so cannot opine directly but we heard good things from other travellers about the **‘Local Street Food Night Tour’** which is a private tour with a local guide and includes 6 tastings per person in the evening. It's a good option if you arrived early in the morning to KL and after resting up during the day fancied a shorter excursion in the evening.

# Private day trip to Cameron Highlands

https://preview.redd.it/1q9ywcwjgxcd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=91810729b4f40deab0680c7663c0950cb46df149

We did this on our last full day before heading back home and it was a really enjoyable way to end our trip. The Cameron Highlands has **amazing and really unique scenery** and is a **great day for nature lovers**. We don’t often do private tours as we enjoy meeting other groups but this tour is recommended to do privately as the journey is long and windy at the end going into the Highlands and is more comfortable to do by car. 

Our journey from KL was long but very comfortable and easy. However we heard a story from people going to the highlands on a public holiday and the traffic was horrendous so we would recommend avoiding during these times. **Highlights were visiting the tea plantation and tastings with breathtaking views and the butterfly park and seeing lots of unique insects too.** The **lunch option on this trip was at a Golf course and was very tasty.** Anuar was our guide and he taught us lots about the Cameron Highlands and the history of Malaysia and was super engaging. He stopped a lot to explain the sites and for plenty of photo opportunities! Overall the trip is well worth the journey and you get to see a lot and it's a nice contrast to being in the city in KL.

**Cameron Highlands Private Day Tour:** [https://www.getyourguide.com/kuala-lumpur-l171/cameron-highlands-day-trip-private-tour-t116014/?partner\_id=XDCPBTG&utm\_medium=online\_publisher](https://www.getyourguide.com/kuala-lumpur-l171/cameron-highlands-day-trip-private-tour-t116014/?partner_id=XDCPBTG&utm_medium=online_publisher)

Other places people told us to visit but we didn’t get a chance this time were the **Batu caves**, actually going into and up the **Petronas Twin Towers** and the **KLCC Park**.

And that concludes our brief post and highlights of our stay in KL!

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas. 

","I think it's mainly got to do with the law where if a motorcycle gets into an accident with a car, regardless of who's actually at fault, the car driver has to lay up || Ah yes, contribute to self bashing. Then again i did choose to ride i suppose.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

And then channel these redundant people to work on something else. || Unfortunately, because we practice a racialist political system, every problem is seen with racial lenses.

So even if we know how to fix the problems with law breaking motorcyclists, there is very little political will to do it.

Most law breaking motorcyclists are identified as coming from a particular race. This means that politicians who are self-proclaimed champions of this race will defend them till the cows come home.

And every time anyone complains about it, the will be seen as enemies of that race.",9/7/2024,4,27,1720507291,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1dyvpg8/lets_hear_your_suggestions_motorbike_culture_in/
Gig worker needing advice and opinions from fellow corporate/office job workers,"TL;DR: Late 20s gig driver with only SPM wanna step into corporate world. Possible? If yes, how?  


Hello guys, a long time lurker here. I need some insights from fellow Malaysians that are currently working 9-5 office jobs on how to transition from a gig worker to an office worker. I'm currently in my late 20s that wanted to change my career after seeing this year's SPM results. Somehow it really got me to think hard about my current lifestyle and the future I wanted to have. As the years go by, my income is still around the same with no upwards career progression or employment benefits. I am still living with my parents so I can get by with my current income but sooner or later I might start my own family as well as taking care of my aging parents. Therefore, I would like to change my gig based job to a proper job that allows upskilling and career progression.

  
My highest education level is only SPM (average results, a few As for languages subjects and Bs and Cs for STEM subjects) and even that SPM result is already more than a decade ago. After SPM result I took on ""kereta sapu"" gigs for a few years before finally getting official PSV license to enroll as a Grab driver. Basically, my skill set revolves around driving people, food, packages, items, etc. from places to places. Maybe customer service/communication skills as well? due to meeting a wide variety of passengers that have different needs. With these skills, I am thinking of getting jobs like HR, business admin and marketing (arranged in order of my interest in as well as jobs that I think matches my current limited skill set)

  
However, on jobseeking sites like JobStreet that some of my passengers suggested to me all of the job postings require either a diploma in related field or minimum years (generally 2 years) of working experience in related field or even both diploma and minimum years of working experience in related field. I have neither of these but I wanted to try stepping into 9-5 office job. Say for example, if I just applied knowing full well I do not have the requirements, what happens then? How do I go about this and step into the corporate world? Do I really have to get a tertiary education in order to step into the corporate world? Personally, I would prefer to have actual working experience rather than getting a diploma first because I'm the type of guy that learns better with hands-on experience rather than theory. I do understand that certain jobs like doctors, engineers and lawyers requires formal education. Is it the same case for office jobs?

  
Any input shared by you guys are greatly appreciated and in return you guys can ask me for stories or experiences as a gig driver.",,16/6/2024,1,0,1718528345,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1dh3i92/gig_worker_needing_advice_and_opinions_from/
Which your fav Nasi Lemak from these choices?,"I know there are more option but I really want to round this selection up to these 3 because they are not only by the 3 major races but they each have a USP - VP nails the Chicken, sambal and rice imho, Bumbung opens late, and Burung Hantu opens late + has the best take away boxes.

Wholesome GrabFood Moment (read caption),"Yesterday I ordered GrabFood and requested cutlery as I didn't have any being a guest in a hotel room.

Then I received a cute WhatsApp message from the food merchant expecting me to pay an extra RM1.05 for cutlery. I refused and made a deal with them in which I promised to leave them a 5-star review after the food was delivered to me with cutlery provided.

Today I ordered something else from the same restaurant and reminded them that I had washed the plastic cutlery given by them yesterday and that they didn't have to provide cutlery this time.

Later in the evening, I received the food thinking it was a wrong order as there was an extra item (spring roll) plus cutlery that I didn't request as I still had the same set from yesterday washed. But then I noticed there was an extra bag of MSG given, which made me wonder who on Earth except Uncle Roger would request an extra bag of MSG for PadThai, it must have been given intentionally by the food merchant to catch my attention hahaha

Soon enough, I realised the order was indeed for me because I saw a wholesome “thank you” note on the box containing the extra spring rolls. I decided to give Kluang Boat Noodle a shoutout on Reddit for their act of kindness hehe...

Looking for feedback on my itinerary for Malaysia & Singapore,"Hello,

In about a month I'll be travelling with my girlfriend to Malaysia and Singapore. We'll stay 3 nights in KL, 3 nights in Penang, 4 nights in Langkawi and 4 nights in Singapore. The stays are fixed but the programme of what we do every day is flexible. 


1. Travel to Kuala Lumpur, plane arrives at 9.30 AM. I suppose we'll probably arrive in KL sentral somewhere in the afternoon? We're hoping to be able to walk in the Petronas towers area, visit the KL tower, KLCC park and maybe do the walk bridges eco forest.
1. AM: Visit Willaya mosque (grab), PM: Thean Hou Temple and visit Chinatown 
1. AM: Batu Caves, PM: Pavillion shopping in the afternoon which is close to our hotel
1. Travel to Penang by train and ferry. Walk around the city centre for a bit after checking into our hotel.
1. AM: Visit Penang Hill by train, Sri Aruloli temple. PM: Visit Kek Lok Si temple
1. AM: Not sure really, perhaps hike to monkey beach and take a boat back?
1. AM: Travel to Langkawi by plane PM: Probably visit Pantai Cenang and/or chill at some beach?
1. AM: Visit the Seven Wells Waterfall and Machinchang natural swimming pool. Maybe the full hike up Mount Machinchang
1. AM: Cable car to Langkawi Sky bridge, PM: Do a kayak tour through the mangroves (maybe better in AM?)
1. Beach day at Tanjung Rhu beach, return to hotel, visit a fire show at Pantai Cenang beach
1. Travel to Singapore, plane lands at 11.30 AM. Again not sure how much time we'll have in the afternoon. Either way our hotel is near Little India so we could definitely explore that and the Arabic neighbourhood. In the evening we could go to Bay Sands Area for the 2 lightshows.
1. Visit gardens by the bay (cloud forest and flower dome) and walk through Orchard Road in the afternoon. Not sure what else to add here? Does it make more sense to visit Bay Sands area in the afternoon and visit the light shows on the same day?
1. AM: Visit the botanical and orchid garden. Perhaps the night safari as well? Should we combine these two and do botanical in the afternoon? If so, any recommendations for AM?
1. Doing a 12k hike in the MacRitchie Nature trail with the treetop walk. Is this worth it? Or is Sentosa Island worth a trip? We don't really care about theme parks, have alread had beach time in Langkawi and would probably only do a short walk and visit S.E.A. (if it's worth it).
1. Fly home


Should I be moving things around? Is it too busy or too little? We like to always have something to do but at the same time we don't want to feel like we have to rush from one thing to another. At the end of the day, we should also have enough time to relax and enjoy all the delicious food. Any feedback?

Thanks in advance!","Since you are doing Kek Lok Si, please visit this minor temple dedicated to the Deity Anthony Bourdain - Penang Air Itam Laksa || >Travel to Penang by train and ferry. Walk around the city centre for a bit after checking into our hotel.

The journey there is going to be long. Doubt you would want to walk in the humid evening after that. 

>AM: Travel to Langkawi by plane

Or take the ferry. PNG to LGK is not that far. 

>AM: Visit the Seven Wells Waterfall and Machinchang natural swimming pool. Maybe the full hike up Mount Machinchang

>AM: Cable car to Langkawi Sky bridge

Do you know that the Langkawi Sky Bridge is also somewhere around the summit of Machinchang? Sure the hike would be a different trail but youre effectively going to be at the same location two days in a row.

>AM: Visit the botanical and orchid garden. Perhaps the night safari as well? Should we combine these two and do botanical in the afternoon? If so, any recommendations for AM?

Mandai (where the zoo + night safari is) is quite far from the city. If youre planning to visit the night safari, might as well make it a day trip with the zoo. Botanical gardens + orchid gardens can be combined with your other city plans.

Judging from your previous planned activities, you would hate Sentosa. 

End note: Youre spending too much time in Singapore. 3 full days and you would be bored out of your mind. Sincerely, Singapore resident. || i would flip the itenary, more days in penang, less in sg || > Do you know that the Langkawi Sky Bridge is also somewhere around the summit of Machinchang?

You're completely right, makes more sense to do both of these on the same day.

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

Visiting Genting Highlands!,"Hello! Me and my family are visiting from India, we will be staying in Genting on may 3rd and 4th. Please bear with me, might be a lengthy post.

We are planning to book a cab from the grab app on 3rd at around 7am and reach Awana Skyway boarding point by 8 am (it shows 50 mins on google maps from our stay in KL).

I recon with all the delays we should reach the chin swee temple by 10 am (I booked express boarding) and after lunch we should check in by 2:30 pm into our hotel.

My plan for day 1 is to explore the mall, the indoor amusement park (2-3 rides) the infinity room and the zip lining at ripley’s, the casino (just for the views and maybe a game - we don’t really gamble) and just roam around in the mall and have good food.

For day 2 I planned to just explore the skyworlds theme park. 

Now my questions are:

- Will I find a grab easily that early in the morning to take me to genting or should I prebook a cab? If yes, any suggestions? Or any better alternatives?

- does the express boarding at awana make any difference? I would be with my grandpa and I don’t want him to stand too long :(

- Also it was advertised that the glass gondola would have max of 6 pax. Is this followed?

- does my itinerary and timings make sense or am I unrealistic about something?

- how is the weather like in genting during this time? What are the rush hours for the theme park?

- would it be better to do the theme park on 3rd, a Friday and the others on the Saturday?

- are there any wheelchair services we can avail at resorts world?

- we would leave genting on the 4th evening. We would like to rent a cab on that day to roam around in KL before getting to the airport. Would you be able to help us with any good services with good value for money?

Thanks in advance, guys. Im sorry if there’s already another thread on this that I missed.","1. May 3 is Friday. Definately get express pass, just in case. Don't penny pinch since you only have 1 visiting chance.

2. They follow the weight limit somewhat strictly. They'll eyeball your body size and decide accordingly. Just take 2 different gondola if you worried about weight limit. They won't charge you extra and there's little to no wait time between each carriage. 

3. Your itinerary seems fine enough. You might not enjoy outdoor theme park as much since we are getting more rain recently. And it's cheaper to rebook the ticket through their website at least 1 day before your entry. You can save alot of money doing that. And children ticket follows height, not age. If I remember correctly, 120cm above are considered as adult so don't buy the wrong one. It's an expensive mistake for me and I don't want you to repeat that.. 

4. You can do whatever park on whatever day that are most convenient for you. It makes no difference as both days are considered as weekend. Friday might be less packed than Saturday since it's still a work day for most. || grab is really hit or miss with the timing of getting a ride and traffic during ride || Is walking around Genting Highlands safe?

Rant about Domino’s,I hate to talk about things but this one is too much and I want to get it off my chest. I ordered from grab at 8:45 pm and after an hour I tried calling them but the line just says their number is no longer available so I had no choice but to wait and my order only arrived after 2 hours. Once I opened my food it was horrible. The pizza had no sauce or dough whatsoever and it wasn’t even cut and then the mozzarella sticks looked so bad my little sister wouldn’t eat it and for context we have ordered from the past and she expects it to be the same. Overall worst ever food experience ever and yes if you see the receipt I paid 68rm for this. I already made a review and emailed both grab and domino’s.,"Oftentimes a lot of these franchises really depend on the branches.

Domino near my house, super awesome! Flavourful, just enough pepperoni and cheese.

Another one few km further down the road, possibly the worst pizza branch I can imagine. || I think you should ask for refund || why would you order dominos on grab. you got mega scammed you can get like double that for rm40 || i thought the 1st pic were the bottom part of the pizza and not the topside. || Malaysia does bad fast food pizza in general. Pizza hut and dominoes SUCKS there || Fuck Dominos, seriously. A couple months ago, I had an extemely sloppy pizza and breadstix that looked like burnt fingers. Looked like whoever made the pizza couldn't be arsed. I told him I'm rejecting the pizza and wanted a refund. It took some back and forth to get the refund from Domino's, so I issued a temporary charge back via credit card. I've since got the refund. What I usually do is order via app and choose store pickup (pay via cash method). Then if the pizza is not up to par either ask them to remake or just don't accept it. The one time I paid before checking (as I was in a hurry), I got burned. Some stores are better than others but always order via app, choose cash payment, and inspect pizza before paying at the store. || I've been in the UK for quite a while. Domino's pizza here is so good, soft crunchy crust and the cheese doesn't come off so easily and the meat is juicy.

Here in Malaysia, they basically serve post apocalyptic pizza.

You can't even complain about it. || Im not sure where youre located, but theres a couple of pizza places that are crazy good. may not have good deals like dominos but idk, cos we eat pizza sekali sekala, we try to eat good ones. tbh would buy dominos, but similarly like you, i had unsatisfactory service with the price i paid. idk if they dont provide training etc but yeah.

Understanding demographics and cultural identities here :),"**Warning:** Long post

It's just been a few days already visiting KL and I must say I am loving it. Beyond trying out foods like nasi lemak, mee tarek, and thosai/dosa or visiting places such as Merdeka square or the Petronas towers, I indulge myself by understanding cultural, linguistic, and ethnic fabric of identities here as Malaysia seems to be an atypical country in that regard. I did SG before so I wasn't as surprised. I am an avid traveler and history/culture buff myself so sociological and athrophological elements are easy to make out. Here are some remarks/questions I have made so far alongside trying to learn a bit of Manglish such as incorporating ""can/cannot"" and ""lah"" (even though that's a difficult one to place in sentences) and saying ""ok k k k k"" in my phrases. I felt we could have a nice discussion where I can be corrected and/or more educated.

1. **Is this term Manglish actually used?** I know the Singlish term is used in Singapore and is also common in general culture/linguistics.
2. It's obvious that Malaysia is known to be a melting pot of malays, chinese, indians, other minorities (yemenis, see below 3c), and the lesser known indigineous peoples.

a) However, I am quite aware that Malays are of different types (spread across different countries like Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and also having become tiny minorities (now mixed even) in South Africa, Sri Lanka, etc.) Is there active instances of malay nationalism/superiority - **can you feel like a second class citizen\***? I read a bit that Malays are defined separately per the constitution. **How is intermixing viewed/seen? Tolerable if the person is Muslim/not-Muslim??**

\***Although, I don't think this would not be the case in chinese-majority populated cities, right?**

b) I understand that the Chinese also speak different dialects i.e. Hokkien, Teochew, etc. I am not so good on Chinese demographics **but people are mostly Han here right?** i.e. the Zhuang peoples don't speak mandarin natively. It seems like there are chinese-majority cities here like Penang, Melakka, etc. **but do you have such cities for Tamils?**

b) Indians or better defined as Tamils (majority ethnic group of Indians here) are also here since generations like the Chinese. In fact, I prefer the word tamil instead of Indian because they left before India become a country even. I've noticed some mixing between tamil and chinese peoples especially if the parents grew up in a multicultural city like KL for example? **Any other cities that are evident of that?** I have also noticed that there are smaller minorities of other Indian ethnic groups that seem to have come in more recently (i.e. their parents for business in the early 80s/90s making them 2nd generations compared to tamils who are 4th generation and beyond) such as sindhis, malayalees, and gujaratis (perhaps I missed out on others).  I know for sure in India it is not common for these ethnic groups to mix unless of course they are from a cosmopolitan city like New Delhi, Mumbai, or are parts of other indian diasporas (who are in temporary residence limbo in the middle-east - dubai for example, has loads of indian communities, often ethnically mixed, going to indian standard schools that teach english there, having some sort of hybrid indian/3rd culture , with very less exposure to the arabic language/emirati culture, but more exposure to resident/expat culture dynamics often inter-generational and intermarriage between various indian ethnic groups - anyway this is off-topic). **What's your take on my analysis on Indians here?**

3. I have come up with the following assessment: nationals, migrants, expats, and diaspora:

a) First, going with the definition that the person who moved is considered 1st generation (unlike the U.S. that messes it up, haha) most chinese are indians (tamils) are over 3 generations here. Let's call them diaspora (since they have integrated) but also nationals (since they have acquired malaysian citizenship) - good evaluation? can or cannot?

b) Then, you have malays, that are also nationals by default. And legally, a malay is a muslim which is interesting. **What happens to converts?** **What is the status of indigineous people here who obviously have nationality as well?**

c) Migrants in this case, one type that I am referring to the lower socio-economic class that have been aiding the country's development of infrastructure - such as bangladeshis and pakistanis (punjabi ethnicities mostly as I have noticed) and they usually live in their communities and in somewhat difficult conditions. **They usually work here, and leave eventually or...? other types -**  some of them set shop in petaling, etc. or get jobs here and there such as restaurants, etc. In some cases, I have seen migrants of the same ethnicity i.e. Indian tamils moved to Malaysia to work due to better economic conditions - same for Chinese who left to Malaysia. This is all 1st gen though. They bring their wives/families here and in some cases, also marry local/intermarry. Also have noticed refugees i.e. Rohingya etc. (**how are they treated?**) - also what is it with semi-naked tamils (can make out) laying in random parts of the streets? Might have seen a chinese or a malay maybe also but why more tamils?- **they are classified as homeless, correct?** Then you also have sex workers who I have noticed from Nigeria and perhaps other sub-saharan african countries and maybe other East Asians as well. Spotted a Moroccan too. I would also put East Asians (Vietnam, etc. in the c/d category?) Have also noticed arabs (from developing or destroyed countries i.e. Egypt/Lebanon/Syria/Yemen settled here as well (again c/d category) and some even marrying local malays and producing 2nd generation mixed arab-malays (easier to marry since they are muslim probably?). If I am not mistaken, yemenis (of the hadhrami ethnicity) are a minority diaspora here having been here for generations so you have these yemeni/malay mixes in some regions.

d) Expats are maybe migrants in the higher socio-economic class. Digital nomads/entrepreneurs/employees nationals of ""developed countries"" working in MNCs/other companies in Malaysia. Good lifestyle, probably don't integrate as much and learn the language as much and kids go to private schools and have this 3rd culture growing up. **A bit of generalization/stereotyping but what do you think?** I've also another type - many muslim expats as well who leave the ""West"" since they are of a muslim/oriental origin i.e. french of algerian/moroccan descent from france having faced institutionalized islamophobia in Europe who settle here for a better, ""balanced"" life since their countries of origin are not as economically stable as Malaysia. other examples can also include british nationals of pakistani/indian (desi) origin working here for MNCs since they have qualified skills and integrate in the muslim dynamic of ML easier.

4. If you have read until this far, THANK YOU. I am typing from my hotel room at 3am since I am so intrigued by all of this. I have a case/story I'd like to share and I really want your input. My wife and I went to petaling and had tea in one of those tea shops. Chinese tea culture is big as you know and we never really experienced it. There was this young Chinese guy in his 20s attending to us. Super kind and taught us a lot about the different tea types. He spoke broken English and said he spoke broken Malay as well. He said he grew up in a chinese majority city and went to mandarin standard school somewhere in Ippoh I think. We managed to converse. I was super intrigued to find out this guy had never been to China all his life and he was basically malaysian national (chinese diaspora) with his great-grandfather having moved to Malaysia. But the guy did not speak enough Malay or good english!? **Is this because he went to Chinese school? Do chinese of a lower socio-economic class send their kids to chinese school? Or do they do it to preserve their culture? Or is it because they are in chinese-majority cities and that is the natural choice? What is your take on this?** Furthermore, after quizzing him, he told me that he stands out from chinese from China i.e. c/d categories above because they can detect he is not from China. Lastly, he said he couldn't even speak his dialect  Fujian? Hokkien? maybe idk I forgot) and he could only speak Mandarin. Overall, he was a bit ashamed of his situation....but he was super nice/kind/friendly - we got discounts even :) this is super interesting because when you take countries like the U.S. where chinese have a history of settling i.e. diaspora (not the immigrants that are now 2nd making 3rd gen z ) - I am talking about the railroad workers of chinese origins who settled in the US, integrated, and speak fluent english and of which many have also preserved their chinese dialects in attachments to vibrant chinatowns. I guess the socioeconomic dynamics make it different since the US did not have ""chinese schools"". Another similar case, but opposite is like the Japanese diaspora in Brazil (over 3 generations coming in the 1900s, many descendants of which barely speak any Japanese anymore).

On the other hand, my Grab driver was a KL native, chinese malaysian, who spoke amazing english + malaysian english dialect (can can bro) + mandarin + cantonese + hokkien + teochew + and...malay! - He said he went to a malay-english school. We didn't have enough time as he dropped me quickly in Bukit Bintang where I was craving to try Durian again (obviously the best type - Musang King haha). What is your take on these two cases? **Does socio-economic status affect language appropriation?** Another Grab driver was mixed - she was chinese and tamil but spoke tamil  (not chinese) and identified with the tamil culture? **Didn't get time to ask her why, but is this common you speak only one language of your mixed ethnicities?**","not common || >can you feel like a second class citizen\*? I read a bit that Malays are defined separately per the constitution. How is intermixing viewed/seen? Tolerable if the person is Muslim/not-Muslim??

Yes. Intermixing is alright. Just convert to muslim.

>  
most chinese are indians (tamils) are over 3 generations here. Let's call them diaspora (since they have integrated) but also nationals (since they have acquired malaysian citizenship) - good evaluation? can or cannot?

I guess that's fair enough. But we mostly call ourselves Malaysians. most youngings have little care for the country of origin anymore. But my parents do have some irrational support for the 'motherland'.

>**What happens to converts?** **What is the status of indigineous people here who obviously have nationality as well?**

Convert into Islam ok. Convert out not ok. Indigenous people are also Malaysians and legally speaking are provided the same benefits as the Malays. It is the non-bumiputera (bumiputera refers to indigenous people incl Malays) that loses out even though we are all Malaysians. That is a cause of a lot of political BS in our country.



>s this because he went to Chinese school? Do chinese of a lower socio-economic class send their kids to chinese school? Or do they do it to preserve their culture? Or is it because they are in chinese-majority cities and that is the natural choice? What is your take on this?

Chinese school considered somewhat superior since the grade on average are better among the students there. So a lot of parents prefer to send them there for that reason alone. But also to preserve racial culture as you said. Plus they want the kids to learn the mother tongue and mix amongst themselves. 

>  
**Does socio-economic status affect language appropriation?**

Probably. Depending on the household situation, most lower income households would not have English as their first or even second language. It would be mother-tongue, then Malay. Or just simply Malay and broken English for the Malay. For higher income groups, they may speak English more often because globalisation, more open and exposed to foreign media etc etc.

>  
**Didn't get time to ask her why, but is this common you speak only one language of your mixed ethnicities?**

Not uncommon. Depending on the household, not all parents care about passing on their cultural heritage to their children. So even if the children biologically inherits the looks of 2 races, they may not have inherited the cultural aspects of both races. Add on the fact that inter-racial marriages have higher probabilities to raise conflicts between families (wife side vs husband side), the child may be alienated from either side of the family as a result. Or divorces. I personally knew 2 former classmates whose parents divorced or separated because of this. They look Chinese, have Chinese names and all but cannot speak a lick of Mandarin. || Contemporary Chinese parents of both lower and higher income classes tend to send their kids to chinese schools these days, and the schools will also reflect the community around them and the degree of english and malay language acquisition.

Also note that at least in the KL/PJ area it's more common to attend a chinese public primary school and then a malay public secondary school, while in say, Penang, attending a chinese public secondary school is more common.

So, if your parents/grandparents happen to be from back when english/malay\* public schools were a thing and use more english than chinese in daily life, and that's also true of your peers, and you consume lots of english language media, then that'll influence your relative fluency in english. Likewise if everyone around you uses mandarin etc. etc.

If we were to use rough stereotypes about KL/PJ (and this is not absolute, exceptions abound etc etc)

Bangsar - upper middle class, english used quite a bit. If you lurk around reddit i suppose you will come across the term ""bangsar bubble"" which pejoratively represents a somewhat sheltered idealistic liberal worldview. You certainly would get a very warped impression of Malaysia if you only stayed in Bangsar and other similar upper middle class neighboorhoods so yeah :D

A more working class area like say, mmm, Kepong, would be much more mandarin heavy, you could probably get by daily life barely using any other language if you really wanted to. 

\*this part in particular amuses me because while i went to a malay primary school, we used english everywhere. mmm. that was 30 years ago though, i imagine it's not so obvious today, as many chinese parents today regardless of them being malay or chinese educated favor chinese schools || try to bring back KKMart socks as souvenir and also Vern shoes. hottest items in Malaysia right now || I will try to answer some of your questions as local Chinese.

  
Q: Is this term Manglish actually used?

A: Yes, Malaysia English usually is a ""rojak"" (mix) between different language. For example: lah (is come from Mandarin 啦)



Q: but people are mostly Han here right?

A: Yes



Q:  What happens to converts? What is the status of indigenous people here who obviously have nationality as well?

A1: Convert remain the same race but changed religion. 

A2: Indigenous people also known as Orang asli (rough translate as native/aboriginal) or bumiputera (rough translate as earth prince), yes they are Malaysia citizen too



Q: They usually work here, and leave eventually or...? other types 

A: Most of them work here as foreign labor via work permit/visa. They return back to their country after the permit expired. Some of them marry the local and start having root here (what you said is pretty much accurate as far as I know)



Q: Rohingya - how are they treated?

A: Not good, but there is a reason for that. If you are interested you may read more onto the history/past of the Rohingya people (especially on those who used to accept them and what is the aftermath, and hence why they are not welcome by most countries/society)



Q: they are classified as homeless, correct?

A: Yes



Q: About the guy who did not speak enough Malay or good English, is this due to he went to Chinese school?

A: As stated he ""grew up in a Chinese majority city and went to mandarin standard school"", likely his circle of friend is only his own race and hence lack of opportunities for him to practice Malay/English. Language is something required constant practice to become fluent.



Q: Do Chinese of a lower socio-economic class send their kids to Chinese school? Or do they do it to preserve their culture? Or is it because they are in Chinese-majority cities and that is the natural choice? What is your take on this?

A: My view: Chinese school is usually better quality compared to national school and at the same time it can be used to preserve their own culture.



Q: Didn't get time to ask her why, but is this common you speak only one language of your mixed ethnicities?

A: Usually the child of intermarriage will pick up the language from both sides, but it all depends on the family.",12/4/2024,10,5,1712957441,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1c2kvnv/understanding_demographics_and_cultural/
Going around for food and what to do in Bukit Nanas,"Hi there! New to town and will be here for quite some time. Asking help to lead me to food stalls or some mom&pop shop around here to get my meals.

I Just Go Robbed In Malaysia,"24.03.2024 at Mercato Grocery Store, Pavilion, KL. I was with my friend looking at cheese, trolley with my bag was behind us. LUCKILY I turn my head around just in time and noticed that my bag is fully opened (2 sections) and a woman (not Malay, foreigner) pulls my wallet from there. She notices me and immediately throws wallet inside food stand, probably to retrieve it later, and immediately starts walking away. I grab my wallet from inside of food stand and start to chase this woman, restraining her and starting to shout “POLICE! HELP! SHE STOLE MY WALLET!”, she started playing dumb. We struggled few minutes until the security came, I must say, there’s a lot of security but they are all useless. There were TWO CCTV CAMERAS ABOVE US. I request to take a look, they refused, said only they and police can take a look. They looked and SAW NOTHING. Literally nobody helped me, I felt like I WAS A CRIMINAL, in fact, there was one man, maybe it’s her husband, but later she said that not her husband who tried to stop me stopping her! JESUS CHRIST! I called 911 (later they told me the number was 991) anyway, the police came, we went to police department and I left the report. Unfortunately, as of right now, it’s my word against her, because my dump friend is so unaware. Luckily, at least they locked her up for a day. I just want for her to pay by the law, I want justice! I was in Malaysia for 3 weeks (2 weeks in Langkawi, loved it) and 1 week in KL, only 1 week left for KL. I’m sorry for errors etc I’m really tired after all this. This was first time when I was robbed, and my first time in Malaysia and my first time traveling abroad. I want to go home right now even more :(

  
UPD: I've got a text update from the policeman that she confessed everything and the charges were pressed in court against her and she got 2 years in jail. Now, I feel complete. Thanks everyone for your replies!","Commiseration. Since the proper channels seemed uncooperative, might I suggest u highlight this on social media (FB / X (fka Twitter / IG / YouTube etc) and tag Mercato, Pavilion, PDRM (Malaysian Police), tourism minister and whoever else u can think of based on the comments this far).

These kinda incidence tend to gain traction on socmed because Malaysians are really wired into socmed. Anywho, just try it out and see what happens.

I hope that this one incident doesn’t taint ur image of Malaysia completely. || Go to the Pavillion offices and try to speak to management about it to make a complaint and stress how useless security were. 

I was in the same Pavillion few months ago and saw what appeared to be a foreign migrant worker (brown skin guy) literally using his phone camera and taking a picture of some womens ass while she was paying for her items at the cashier...this was in a department store at like 2PM!!!

There were people around but I think they did not take notice. Security guards? They were not doing any patrols to spot these things and just standing at the entrance being useless. Before I could stop that guy he quickly walked off. 

This is what happens when businesses want to cut costs and hire cheap labor who don't know the job and can't be bothered to because of low pay.

Pavillion is a premium mall in KL and so for these things to be happening is a huge tarnish on their reputation. || Since you made the police report, wouldn’t that make it so that the police can look through the cctv records? Maybe you can ask the police to do so || Police busy raiding socks manufacturers || When employers/business owners cut costs and hire raw untrained people. There's always a saying, ""it is not important until it happens to you"". Until it does, it's too late || Nowadays , Almost need to be viral so the police can take action.

This remind me of my experience, One of my crew just Mobilized to offshore and when he got to his room, opened his locker, saw a suspicious plastic bag, turns out there were drug.  
He immediately Reported the finding.

He got demobbed the same day, even being blamed and being told he should've throw it in the ocean.  
His identity as whistle-blower wasn't even protected.  
This got the narcotic police involved, he and 2 other suspect was interrogated by the narc police as if he's a criminal(this is normal, since it could be sabotage attempt , we would not know, but my crew doesn't even know who was the previous occupant or who the guy is), sitting side by side with the previous occupant of the room (the suspect).

In the end after 8 hours of interrogation, all was released with no arrest. I was waiting outside whole time for him, and before we went back, the police give us an advice, saying this is serious stuff and can get someone life ruined, next time when you found something like this just throw it away and avoid involving narcotics police for this small amount of drug.

I was disappointed hearing that, and my crew told me, what if he throw it away, then the owner actually looking for him and causing more problems. || Easy. Boycott Pavillion. What a useless shithole. Totally non-customer friendly service to visitors. What more locals || You'll be amazed at this day and age the CCTV footage will be grainy and unrecognizable.  The Genting casino ones can zoom right up to the tiny mole on the hands. || The wallet may have fingerprints. Alternative will be witness, unlikely getting volunteer.

Sorry to say this but don't expect much from our police, they just take your report and call it a day, did you lost anything or any damages to your bags or wallet?

GrabFood Now Lets You Avoid Small Order Fees By Purchasing Vouchers - Lowyat.NET,,"Pay rm4 now and for your next order, you ""Avoid"" the rm2 small order fee!

This is a scam. You're essentially paying those small order fees in this order, for a potential saving on your next order. If your next order isn't small, you're already paying for it.

* Buy voucher rm 4
* Rm 2 from the voucher covers next order, can't use voucher on current order

Vasectomy Experience in Malaysia 2023 - (Private Med Centre),"Hi all, I'm here to share about my vasectomy experience in Malaysia.

I'm a 28M, Chinese. And you must be wonderin' ""eh, so young already go for the snips?"" The answer brother, is yes. But for those who are curious, here are the reasons why I would share that some of you might relate:

* In this economy, I have no money to raise a child. Buying a house is hard enough. Treating myself to a good snack once a while is hard enough. Buying groceries is expensive enough.
* And, rather than raise another hungry mouth to feed, I would much prefer to give back to my parents. They are old, they're not gonna be there forever, so I wanna show them my love by sponsoring their holidays, hiring a maid to make their lives easier, buying dyson and robo vacuums so they dont have to do their own housework, etc. Things that actually improve the situation rather than to *have kids for the sake of the family name or cuz society has deemed it that everyone's path in life is to eventually have kids.*
* My partner and I are sexually active, and we had a few close calls when it came to contraceptives failing. I myself have anxiety when it comes to contraceptives failing;
* I do not wish for her to go through any hormonal contraception (those are terrible).
* And, most importantly, my partner and I are aligned in our goals in life, in this case - if we ever want children, it'll be to adopt.

The only cons is that  my gorgeous partner and myself will never get to see our beautiful mini-mes that we could have (cuz we have good genes, if I do say so myself hahah).

Anyway, let's go.

**Part 1: Consultation**

I did my consultation in SJMC. I have done my research  in reddit here and there were certain doctors that other Msians recommended, if not mistaken one in Prince court and a Dr. Lim in Sunway (if I'm not mistaken). But by the time I found out about Dr. Lim i had already found my doctor.  
My partner was going for a body check up so I thought, maybe i can use the time to just meet a urologist and go for a consultation, to check my balls if they are in good shape for a vasectomy. I didn't specify for a doctor (cuz I hadn't known of Dr. Lim at that time) so from their panel of urologist I just randomly chose one.

Dr. Bala was the doctor prescribed to me. A 50 y/o indian doctor. He had asked me if I was sure if I wanted to do the snips which was irrreversible (low chance of reversal and very very damn expensive). He drew me a dic\* pic explaining the process and whatnot, then proceeded to touch my balls in a medical manner HAHAHAA. After getting the greenlight from him,  and further questioning if I'm sure about it or not, I proceeded to book a date with him for the surgery. At this point, I was like, okay for convenience sake, I'll just go with him, what could go wrong right? dun dun dunnnnn\*

I booked the surgery date couple months later. They asked me to decide if I wanted to go for General Anesthetic or Local. GA - going under the gas would cost up to 6-7k i was told.

\**In comparison, a gov hospital you can get EVERYTHING done in less than 200rm. Go look up some* r/malaysia *threads on vasectomy about a dude who did it there. The reason I didnt do it via government was cuz Im not married and I didnt want to go through their SOPs. Calling spouses, calling parents..yada yada.*

LA would be about 1K cheaper than GA but you would feel the pain. Bala said that on the scale of 1-10, the pain would be a 6. And tbh, 1K is a lot of money for me. I actually preferred to bear the pain and go for LA but he insisted on GA since it's my first time having surgery and that I'm young(?). Ok, fine.  
His assistant, Ms. Chanthra has been very helpful (if not a little judgemental - she also looked shock and asked if I was sure). At this point I was beginning to get a little annoyed. The reason I came to private was cuz I wanted to avoid all this judgements anyway. Booked the date and head home. Bill came up to RM100-120 for the consultation and ball touching by the doctor (damn, what a job right?).

**Part 2: Surgery Day**

This is when things start to get dicey.  
My partner and I came via Grab cuz the doctor advised not to drive after GA operations.  
My partner has been very supportive. As calm as i was, having my first operation was pretty daunting. So I give all the thanks in the world to her for spending her day with me there.

We reached at 8.30am. Before I head in, I gave the love of my life a long, hard hug. It's a minor surgery but like, you know. If anything went wrong - - touchwood\*.

I got dressed in a gown, kept my belongings in a locker they provided and then the nurse asked if I shaved, which I did the day before. It wasnt the cleanest but I trimmed the top parts and for my rambutans I tried to be as clean as possible, shaving cleanly there. The nurse said, had I not shaved they would ask for a male nurse to do it for me. so THANK GOD I SHAVED.  Imagine if he shaved me and I got excited and- - - -.

Anyways, I was on a bed in this daycare room, rolled into the surgery department to meet the anesthetician. A very nice Indian lady who also asked me if I was sure about the vasectomy. Up until this point, I had noticed a few glances whenever nurses read my board chart and noticed that I am about to get the snips. I have a very young face, so im 28 they might have thought I was 25 or something. Nevertheless, she was quite nice about it, stating that ""dont want to bring a child to this sad world, huh?"".

Then in comes Dr. Bala. He read my charts and AGAIN asked me a few more times if I was sure. THis time, I got annoyed. like I had already told him my reasoning and told him I'm damn sure. I get it if he had reservations but bro, you asked me like 5 times already. I. Am. Damn. Sure. Bruh... After reassuring him, he said ""Okay, let Dr XXX (forgot her name) the anesthetician be the witness that you agree to this"". *So melodramatic ...wtf.*

Then he left and they rolled me into the operation theater. Damn that was cool. Like lying down and getting rolled whilst seeing the white lights above you flash by. It's like the movies. Anyway, on the operation theatre, the nurses were very nice. They explained what was happening. They put oxygen for me through the breathing mask, which was cool (these things are expensive). Then they gassed me with anesthetic, which smelled like rubber. THAT WAS EXTRA COO- - - thud. blackout.

*\*FYI, i've heard that in western countries, doctors who did LA invited their spouses to watch.*

**Part 3: Post Surgery**

I woke up about 3 hours later (I think). It was about 1230 and I was back at the daycare area. I woke up feeling groggy a few times then went back to sleep. After awhile I woke up, stare at the lights and nurses doing their stuff. Then I noticed something wet around my crotch area. I opened the blankets and noticed that I was bleeding. LIKE A LAWT. The bandages on my grapes looked like it had been haphazardly done. Just a cotton patch and some tape. I called for the nurses and whimpered ""I think i'm bleeding"" - to which they promtply cleaned me up and gave me a proper dressing. I bled, so much the bed had stains, and my thighs as well.

This was red flag #1 for me. Like, damn could I have died if I continued sleeping there and not noticed it? Anyway, I had to wait for Dr. Bala to come and check on me. They called for him and asked me to wait, giving me a cup of hot milo which was damn heavenly.  It was about noon, lunchtime. Nurses was eating, I was just there on the bed. I didnt have my phone so i just stared at the ceiling. An hour+ passed, still no Dr. Bala.

I heard them try to reach Dr. Bala more than a few times at this point, and I just wanted to go home now. It was a Saturday so they were working half day only and some nurses had began to go home. Some of them even muttered that Dr. Bala is suppose to have a surgery now but he's nowhere to be found. Dammit. Red flag #2. After seemed like eternity, he finally arrived. He asked how I was feeling, checked my bandage (more like had a 5 second look at it) and gave me the greenlight to go home. I was kinda pissed, I expected him to touch my balls or something. Like, give it your tender, loving, doctorly care...I waited a LONG time for this and almost died!

I was wheeled out (which was kinda cool) and my partner greeted me with the warmest of smiles. We went to the ground floor to make my payment which was a whopping 7K plus. While waiting for the Grab, we scanned through the bill and found a few funny entries:

* Exploration of scrotum (operation): 1000RM
* Exploration of scrotum (anesthetician): 450RM

Wow, what a job. I'm in the wrong line of work.

My love and I had korean food and walked around Subang after that. I had some minor discomfort around my balls but other than that I was okay. On a scale of 1-10, it was a 4 for now. Also note, that i was not prescribed pain killers.

**Part 4: Post-Surgery Recovery**

Went home after that, and took a bath. I had to be careful not to wet my balls so taking a bath was super inconvenient. Then I stayed in bed. My recovery period was a long process. For days I stayed in bed, the pain would go up to a 7 sometimes. It was hard to sleep cuz I couald only sleep straight and I had to spread my legs. I wore only boxer briefs, using it to support my balls.

At about Day 5, I was feeling better. Then I gave in and made love with my partner. Still with condom though for obvious reasons. There was no problem with ejaculating but due to the motions, my balls were swinging a little and that was a little discomforting. After sex, there was a spike in pain (up to a 7) and then my partner gave me ice to cool it off.

There are 2 incisions on my balls. A small one on the right and a longer one on the left. The left one felt more pain and it felt like there it was swollen underneath. In terms of my balls in general, it was a little swollen and there were blue black bruise spots.

**Part 5: Post -surgery consultation**

About 10 days after my surgery, I was scheduled to see Dr. Bala again. He showed me a report that stated that my vas deferens tube was sent to the lab and confirmed that it was the right tube that was cut off. I'm like ""wait, wdym it was the correct tube. like y'all didn't know which tube it was when you cut me??"" He said that there are lots of tubes in my scrotum and there is no way to 100% tell which was the correct one during surgery. He went on to say that the procedure was like this:

* Incision to cut the tubes
* Tie them and point them backwards, while adjusting the position so they're not directly facing each other and putting some tissue in between to block the cut tubes from each other.

He said that he did not point them all the way backwards, just in case in the future I wanted to reverse it (altho, the chances are still super slim). TBH, I WAS LIVID. I wanted this to be permanent, like I'm paying you 7K to make sure I dont have babies and you are telling me that instead of going 100% at your job, you consciously went 80%, because of your own beliefs. WTF. Major Red Flag (red flag #3 now).

Doctor checked my balls and gave me clearance to have sex. *But little did he know, ahem. I had already had sex twice at this point.* I scheduled a sperm analysis with Ms. Chantra in about 3 months, and then I went home.

**Part 6: General Recovery**

As I mentioned above, my recovery period was long. I had sex every now and then but I had to be careful not to swing my balls too much. The right side was healing fine but the left incision still felt slight pain. And by now, around 2 weeks after surgery, my balls were really swollen and black (and it started to smell a little because I couldnt directly wash it) - so much so that I called the doctor to confirm that it was normal. He recommended not to use ice as it was sensitive and just told me to leave it alone. My partner continued to help me ice it every now and then because for me, icing it really helps. 

**Part 7: Infection**  
So mid-recovery, around week 3, I went grocery shopping. It was a quick one so I didnt put any underwear on (my habit). And this turned out to be a disaster. Because I was walking fast, my balls were wrecking. Like, Miley Cyrus wrecking. It felt quite uncomfortable and when I went home, I noticed there were clear liquid on the left side of the incision. *pus most probably.* It felt quite uncomfortable and it was still in a semi swollen state. This was close to Christmas so when I called Ms. Chantra, no one picked up.

I head to my favourite local clinic and had them to check it for me. Poliklinik dan Surgeri Eko Medicare 仁善家庭医务所. This is a very very good clinic. Affordable with no hidden fees and the doctors are super nice. It's my go-to clinic now.

The doctor confirmed that I have an infection and there was pus building up inside my balls. He mentioned that it was normal but I needed antibiotics to quell the swelling. He gave me 2 options: oral antibiotics or x3 butt jabs on 3 days back to back (which were more effective). Because the jabs were pricey, I opted for x1 jab then, and then oral antibiotics. First time having a jab on my buttocks so it was kinda cool. Not pain just really sore later on. He also gave me a antiseptic spray to spray on the left incision. It was not fully closed (Unlike the right incision which was healing just fine). One week later, there were not much swelling and the doctor cleared me.

I went online and searched for vasectomy recovery process. Those western guys, they can heal in less than 5 days and start masturbating or having sex. I came to know that this has got to do with the Dr's skills so Im like ""damn, Dr. Bala's skills arent exactly the best  I tell you"". About 1 month after surgery, the incision was almost healed and the swelling was gone. I still sprayed the antiseptic spray after showering just to be sure.

**Part 8: Semen Analysis**  
It's been 2 months since the surgery. And in regards to semen analysis, I found 2 things:

* People in the West, the doctors gave them a card to ejaculate every day for about 21 days non-stop.
* Over here, the standard practice is to wait for 3 months after operation, for the tubes to be cleared of those little swimmers. The tubes are very long so it takes time to clear.

So what I did, I combined the two. Either my partner and I got it on everyday, or I jerked off. I wanted to clear my tubes and be sure that they were cleared. 11 weeks after operation, I did my 1st semen analysis at Eko medicare. I abstained from ejaculating for 3.5 days before the test. The test cost me RM130, I had to jerk off in the toilet and they had to courier the fresh sample to the lab. Within hours I got written confirmation that I was home free. And in 2 days I got the report that there was 0 sperm in my sample. Like dude, one drop of semen can contain a million of them spermies and now in one generous amount that I donated in my sample, there's none??! Hooray!!!

That night, I made sweet sweet love to my partner. And boy... It.Was.Worth.The.Wait. The feeling of doing it raw and the fact that you get to have peace of mind is the best. And for her, she can attest that it felt way, wayyyyyyy better. We can do more positions without worrying the condom will slip off or tear, we can bang wayy harder too.

And, lemme add in something, when I'm on alcohol, my little bro goes limp, and wearing a condom then, would almost guarantee that I'll take 1+hours to cum, with 200% concentration, and making my partner sore/tired of it. But without it, I could ejaculate in a very comfortable time frame, one that doesnt make my partner sore but at the same time, give her the best time of her life. And, I never go limp even when I'm on alcohol. The feeling is just....*Heavenly.*

To be on the safe side.  I waited for a week and did my scheduled test at SJMC. This time I failed to abstain. *I mean, when you have a super hot partner, rilling you up for funsies, it's really hard to keep it in your pants.* So the morning after I went to SJMC to do my test.  I was given a note by the lab assistant. The first instruction was: to abstain for 2-3 days before the test. I'm like, welps. At least, this is just a complementary test.

I jerked off into a sample container, it wasn't much cuz well, 12 hours ago I just came anyways. And 3 hours later, I got confirmation that I'm home free. Dr. Bala also had a look at it, and they emailed me the official report but..yea..Home free...Free willy...xD

So yea, here's my story. Telling people I had a vasectomy still surprises them (cuz of my age and well) but yea.

I would like to confirm that this is indeed the best contraception there is. I'm lazy to type it out but for those who don't know, these are some discoveries that I've found that are good to know and can confirm after ample research done:

* If you're thinking of doing it, do look at the other threads and find the better doctor there. Don't go to Dr. Bala. I wish I hadn't.
* Male vasectomy = best contraceptive. If you have anxiety and worry a lot, this is the best way to do it. I'm the type of person that double chekcs the condom after every use so...
* Never ever ask the female to do it (hysterectomy). Theirs is more complicated, costs more and is very very painful.
* Just bear the pain a little and do LA. Save money and use the money to treat yourself after the surgery
* Hormonal pills for women? Please dont. The weight gain, depression and hormone changes are really really not worth it.
* Silicone lube > water lube. Water lube has glycerin and other stuff that might be very sensitive to women's pewpew. If your girl doesnt feel comfortable post-sex/has UTI, double check this. You can google the list of ingredients online that yall should stay away from when it comes to lube.
* Vasectomy might naturally reverse in years to come. there's a term for it I'm too lazy to google, but your body is constantly fighting against the vasectomy procedure, in hopes of healing your tubes and connecting them. So do a sperm analysis test every year or every few years. Throwing a hundred for this once a year, is wayyy worth it than making your other half unexpectantly pregnant.

That's all. Stay safe, Play safe y'all. Now for me and my partner to have fun. ;)

Edit: TLDR; formatting

* Went to Dr. Bala at SJMC for Vasectomy.
* Operation itself costs 7k for GA. LA would be cheaper by about 1K+
* Semen analysis cost at SJMC is RM80
* I do not recommend Dr. Bala for his unprofessional service - Took me about 3-4 weeks to fully heal. No painkillers were prescribed by SJMC.
* For those who want to try government procedure can read about it [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/xdt7au/government_vasectomy_part_2/)","Wow, such a long but interesting post

Looks like a week of leaves taken worth the assurance for a lifetime || 1. Why do you think your dick doesn't go limb anymore after you consume alcohol ?  

2. Pre-vasectomy, how frequent did you have sex on average roughly ? Post-vasectomy (after you have recovered and stabilised), how frequent do you have sex on average roughly ?  

3. Have you tried withdrawal and day counting ?  

4. Is your penis circumcised ?  

5. When raw dogging, how long do you last roughly ?  

6. Does your wife swallow ? If so, can she tell any difference in taste and texture ?

and the sex. is it different? when u cum, the feeling is the same? || Did I read it wrongly, 21 times a day?

Anyway, welcome to the club and sorry for your unpleasant journey. I did mine with Dr Lim from SYMC 6 years ago. It was done by LA and I can drive back few hours after surgery. 

The incursion was less than an inch and recovered within a week. One of the cuts did have infection but not swelling, resolved by antiseptic cream. 

Dr Lim told me to maintain safety SOP for 1 month and allow to jerk when wound is closed up and no discomfort which help to clear up any sperm produced before surgery. Result show the procedure was successful after one month. || That was a long and painful procedure and on behalf of your partner, thank you for taking one for the team. Yes, pills are horrible for women and the procedure for women is considered a major surgery. 

Btw, that dr bala is a walking red flag. Did you file a complaint to the hospital? Not giving pain meds nor antibiotics after a procedure… damn… my hubs did it at gov hospital and boy did we have to endure loads of questioning coz we only have 2 girls and since I am healthy and can still carry more child. Nope. Lol. || I work in medical and the repeated questioning isn't for you but to protect us if one day you suddenly decide to have kids or parents force you to have kids & you come back to Dr Bala and you start an argument right there in the consulting room. Believe me we have seen our fair share of screaming patients asking the impossible. Plus you placing multiple red flags one which says he didn't attend to you when you asked for him it's not fair to him when he could be with another patient so cut him some slack.

Advice for Tourist,"Hi!
First time travelling to KL with family in the summer and would love to know the procedure getting to KL (Such as the entry form found on the Malaysian website). 

What is the best way of payment to use like Grab (Been told this is the most efficient and cheap method of transportation). 

Also, any good food places near KL as it’s only like a 2 day trip there. I know this is a whole lot to ask but first time going and I’m anxious and wanted to make sure everything goes smoothly. 

Thank you in advance to whoever helps out!","* grab is ride hailing, it uses credit card
* if you are doing a 2 day trip, just stick to kl and do the tourist trail || 1. Its pretty easy to enter Malaysia. Fill up the online form , queue up for the first time - although you might be able to use the eGates (depending on your passport that you hold) 
2. Grab - Just link it to your credit card. It's like Uber, if you use Uber in Malaysia - you'll get a prompt to download Grab :) 
3. KL hop and off bus is a good way to experience it. Easy as! || That was my plan. I’ll check out what the tourist trail is. Thanks for the help! || Thanks for the info!!",20/2/2024,0,4,1708415266,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1avc6hl/advice_for_tourist/
What to do during 10-hour layover,"I have an international connecting flight and will be spending 11\* hours at the KL Airport from 9 PM  to 8 AM the next day. Assuming that I will allot 1 hour before and after each flight for immigration processes, I might have 7 hours to spare in the area.

Any suggestions on what I can do around KL during these hours? I was hoping to see the Petronas Towers and try authentic Malaysian food as well. Sleeping is not an issue for me since I'm used to a different timezone. Would also appreciate tips on transportation. Many thanks!

EDIT: Was able to spend 2 hours in the city center with lots of time to spare before boarding the next flight, since I my airline already took care of transferring my baggage and I only had to go through immigrations. Booking a grab was quick. Was able to try a Malaysian restaurant within walking distance from the twin towers. KL is really nice at night! Thanks for all the tips!","Bad news. KLIA is nowhere near KL city. It'll take at least an hour (minimally) to get to kl. The klia Express train would be faster. 
Also, for international flights it's advisable to be at the airport at least 2 hours before your flight. 

That takes 3-4 hours off your 10-hour layover. If you land at 9pm, by the time you get out, you'll reach KL city centre sometime around 11-12 midnight. You'll only be able to see the twin towers from outside. Most shops will be closed by then. There's nightlife in clubbing areas and 24-hour mamak (Indian muslim) eateries, but that's about it. 

Here's the klia express train schedule for your perusal to help with your scheduling. 

 https://www.kliaekspres.com/schedule/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA5rGuBhCnARIsAN11vgRGxigHGGJly1JLCUcwrmhLJInmc3lmlNIv-O9G-G3eduKkDh67-I4aAswMEALw_wcB || You can take the KLIA Express to KL Sentral, then take the LRT to KLCC station to see the Twin Tower.

For dinner, you can try the Nasi Kandar Pelita, it's 10mins walk from KLCC, or you can take Taxi/Grab.
https://maps.app.goo.gl/fReMke9nPj1mrDvC7 || Dude you can do a lot. Just take into account that taxi/Grab will take an hour from downtown to KLIA.

KLIA , Twin tower, bar hopping, foot/body massage, bar hopping, eat local food, bar hopping .. KLIA 

Wear summer clothes, comfortable shoes, and no showing off || Thank you for the comprehensive guide! I checked out the express train schedule and noticed that the last trip is at 12mn and the first trip is at 5am. What can I take to get back to the airport before 5am?

Additionally, do you have any recommendations for 24 hour places to eat? || Thanks a lot for the guide and recommendation! || Thanks for this! || Before 5am, you'll have to get a taxi or a grab. Grab allows prebooking for early morning airport trips. But it'll cost more than the kl express train. 

All 24 hour restaurants will have it on their signboard. Unfortunately, I can't name specific places as I live in the suburbs outside of kl and rarely venture into the city centre at night. Haha. They'll be generally Indian or Indian Muslims restaurants. Most other places close by 10pm. Unless they're pubs/bistros. Those sometimes stay open until 2am. || May I ask about the expected fares of grabs/taxis to the airport? 

Once again, thanks for the tips! || A Grab would cost between rm52-rm115. The big difference is based on the type of car, time of the day (peak hours are more expensive), and whether you prebook or need the ride immediately. 

 https://www.grab.com/my/fare-check/

Taxis are about rm80-90, but it's safer to get an official airport taxi or ""limousine"" as regular metered taxis will often up the price, especially if you look foreign. If you're looking to get to klia from klcc before 5 am, be expected to pay between rm80-rm 150. This price is just an estimate, but if anyone tries to charge you more than rm150 as a solo traveller, they're definitely trying to scalp you. Mpv taxis for families of 4, with luggage, may go up to rm200+.

Possible child trafficker ?,"Hi guys. Exactly on 14/2/2024 9.14pm i went down from my house ( 10th Floor) to ground floor to collect my dinner from grab. In the lift with me was this guy, almost 6'7 very tall maybe Arabian guy ( looked middle eastern for sure) who i didnt not pay much attention to.

I went out to the lobby to take my food and head in to the lobby area to wait for the life. At the lift area was this guy standing and waiting with five kids. One teenage boy was maybe 15 - 16 years old and beside him was four female childrens max at the age of 6 or 7 waiting there ( all of them looked like local malay or indonesian ). One of the kids was standing with a huge luggage ( it was bigger than her) and the Tall guy was holding another super huge cooler box. One of the girls was crying really hard and saying "" mana umi ? "" "" nak umi "" and she kept pulling the shoulders of another girl who was maybe abit elder than her and kept asking those two questions while crying. All the other kids were very weirdly quiet just standing.

I made the move to go over to the crying girl and asked her "" mana umi ? "" and the Guy mentioned earlier ( tall guy) turned and glanced at her with considerable angry/sinister face with a hand gesture to keep quiet. The girl ignored me and kept crying and asking her friend the same question. The guy turned and looked at me and realized i was staring at him and quickly turned away. They entered the lift together with me and all of them very still eerily quiet with only one of the girl crying. The teenage boy tried very hard to avoid eye contact with me too. The tall guy pressed 30th floor on the lift and i pressed 10th floor. I walked out once my floor came and turned one last time to see that girl's face who was still crying.

Can there be a logical explanation to this ? I dont think I can call the cops just based on my assumption and blind suspicion. I can identify the guy 100% and ive been living here for years and only one guy looks like him. Finding his house at 30th floor wont be hard either. What should i do next ? I remember every small details about the incident because it was a very weird situation to see. Really need some help, this is a peaceful community and im very worried there might be a child trafficking ring inside our apartment hidden in plain sight.


Edit: anyone from law enforcement can confirm is this is a valid police complain to make without it being considered laporan palsu maybe ?

Edit: called the cops and made a full report described everything in detail. Police guy said now polis peronda will be in touch with me and im waiting for their call. Thanks to everyone

Edit: police called me and me describe everything again, informed me they will come down and check the lobby and call me if needed. Didnt even ask me the time of occurence so i guess no one will check the cctv but we shall see. He also said will contact me if needed but i doubt so because he said takpe saya tengok dulu when i said to call me if he need any info.

Edit: at Balai Polis IPD now making another report for cctv search and house search to be done as soon as possible, apologies for the delay


Edit: Police informed CCTV search and house check can be done by tonight as security at my place is 24 hours. But im unsure if i will get an update on what was the conclusion, regardless still here at IPD talking to them 🤣

Edit: Police is calling some special unit to conduct the search tonight itself. Im still sitting here with work tomorrow morning 🫠


Edit: Special task force unit searching the premises. I just came back home and waiting for their call for good news or bad news.

Edit: I havent sleep, will give an update very soon. Just gonna take a shower,  and chill first.

Edit: Police thoroughly searched the premise and i waited at the cctv control to see it all unfold. Weird ending : A mother left 9 of her children to be taken care by a tall creepy foreign man and went somewhere for weeks. All children were unharmed and the cops called the mom to confirm this information. Me and police were both speechless by this act by the mother but at the of the day no one was harmed and police double confirmed all kids were fine. Thank you to everyone who was here, i really mean it when i say. Dont be an idiot like me and call the cops before posting on reddit 🤣. The cops were so helpful and did not even blame me 1% but congratulated me and made me feel better. A weird ending for sure because of mom's choices of action but nevertheless no one was harmed 💕

Unexpected Edit: Someone from an NGO like that texted me that the explanation is sus and they would like to take a look further. Passing all details i know to them for this to be looked into from a child abuse/neglect case rather than trafficking. 🙏🏽","pls call polis and update us. || Thank you everyone. Please dont feel hesitant to report ANYTHING suspicious. In my case, fortunately nothing bad happened but it might not be the case next time. I got to speak with some people today that I will not speak to again in my life and was exposed to many horror stories of child kidnaps and trafficking in South East Asia. Its not exxageration that thousands and thousands of innocent children has vanished into thin air. Again, dont be an idiot like me and call police AS SOON AS POSSIBLE before posting on reddit  Your instinct might save someone's life, not a cliche phrase anymore for me after today. Lets all keep an eye on each other. **Every blind eye you turn is a blind eye turned on you**. Thank you again, good morning and good luck to me at work 🤣 || Call the police Better safe than sorry || of course u can call police based on your assumption. police will clarify whether it is or not. thats not your job. || Call the police dude. Police there to help, you won't get anywhere if you don't call them. || Call the police. Can go direct bukit aman to talk to the unit handling vices/trafficking. I cant remember the section of the act, but if not mistaken anything to do with child trafficking they won’t require warrant. 

And it’s not your job to determine if this is a genuine case or not. Every report/tips submitted to police will be treated as genuine unless it is proven otherwise. And the way I see it you’re more scared of the repercussion towards you than the safety of the kids. Which you shouldn’t be, the police will not reprimand you for “misinformation” or “false report” if you genuinely believed in your action. 

Please please please act fast. If this is truly the case, these traffickers, if they sensed they are no longer “safe”, they will move the victims to another area swiftly. || Call the cops, the kids future might depend on you || When we were living in Jakarta a friend of mine worked for the Fairmont hotel there. The presidential suite had been rented by a Saudi family, she came to deliver a package and saw a naked Indonesian girl standing looking terrified about 5-6years old and had been “roughed up”. She tried to take the girl and they made a big commotion, she tried to complain to hotel management but was told nothing could be done and to keep quiet. She didn’t return to work the next day. Heartbreaking. 

Call the police but more importantly, do a follow up. Thank you for not choosing to turn a blind eye and ignore your intuition. Fingers crossed no harm come to these innocent children. 😔💔 || Read your update, OP, and my first thought was, ""god I hope the mom isn't pimping out her kids to this man."" Anyone, with a single brain cell of commonsense, knows it's stupid and sus to leave their kids for WEEKS with a single man. || Pls update.

What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?,"Spent a year in Bangkok during the pandemic when they were handing out unlimited ""Covid extensions"" before travelling around elsewhere. I've been back in Malaysia recently and I noticed things have changed so much before I left. Mostly, what's with all the shortened opening hours?

Most 7-Elevens in my area (Mont Kiara, KL) and the surroundings are closed by midnight.   
FamilyMart shuts by 2 am.  
The only convenience store that opens 24 hours is KK Mart but it almost never has anything I want.

Also, GrabFood's severely limited past midnight, with little other than *mamaks* and Middle Eastern food (coming all the way from Bukit Bintang).

I'm mostly awake during US working hours, so the limited options available is really getting to me.

I've lived in KL since 2006 and I remember the city used to have much more life in the past-midnight hours.

Have things really changed a lot since 2021, or is it just me?","Yeah, people have begun to demand actual living wages and better working hours.

That, and the stronger restrictions on immigration that made it harder for foreign workers to enter. || Lack of workers due to a somewhat recovering economy and some issues with importing workers from Bangladesh

People are now opting for actual jobs, as the job market is slowly recovering while the supply of foreign workers was stopped for quite a while during COVID and afterwards due to syndicates/negotiations (notice how Mamak restaurants were understaffed a few months ago?) 

In other words, those sectors you see with short opening hours are understaffed and are not hiring enough people

The number of Grab drivers has decreased significantly due to smaller commissions and the economy recovering, so a lot of the previously unemployed who worked with Grab are now getting proper jobs || Many places that used to operate 24hours already cut down their operating hours post covid. 

People also more careful with their spending. || Other premises I'd probably just chalk it up to lack of demand.

But what I don't understand is Grab(Taxi) operating hour: aren't you suppose to haul a taxi instead of driving yourself when you're night drinking outside? 

What's the point of it if they stop operating pass 12 am? 

If it's the hassle of working pass 12 am, Uber already have a solution of allowing them charge high price to compensate for it. || for consumers? yes it’s good to have 24hrs shops for convenience. However, lots of European countries close much earlier than that. This is because workers are humans too, and they need a great work-life balance. I’m not saying we should be like them, but things are not the same as before, people are tired of taken advantage to work long hours. I think we are approaching a better path rather than having a standard for being too convenient all the time. || 24hr shift work not good for health.

I argue that shift work should be abolished except for essential services workers like healthcare - for those working shifts, more days off must be granted in lieu.

>What is with the short opening hours in Malaysia these days?

Sorry but the way you phrase the question sounds like an entitlement to me. 

People deserve better working hours and conditions. || I asked the same question to the staff of the local FamilyMart (closes by 11pm) and 7-11 (closes at midnight). They both used to be 24-hour outlets but not anymore since the height of the pandemic. Even after PKP 3.0 i.e. Abah’s Last Stand, they never reverted to their original operating hours. When I asked, the staff replied that the owners of the respective outlets felt that after-midnight sales are not enough to justify opening at those hours, so the owners decided to close before/by midnight. The local KK continues to be a 24-hour outlet even to this day, but the owner makes do by switching off the air conditioning in the store, and have only 2 staffers in the store past midnight. || Less purchasing power due to not good economy thus shop limiting their hours plus convenience store like 7e prone to get rob also due to people get lay off they turn to being criminal. || You have to understand that it's a commercial decision as AFAIK our government doesn't require businesses to pay workers more if their shifts are outside traditional working hours, so long as the working hours don't exceed the maximum allowed. .
(different from some countries like Australia where govt impose penalty/restriction on some businesses opening late)

So in malaysia if they close early is likely because business operations realised they won't make a good profit extending their hours, maybe cause employees want more pay outside traditional working hours, or infrequent customers to justify the expense. || Who in MK is going to work past midnight? the staff don't stay there. 

I mean the people in MK who worked in the 7E and McDs and whatever, were bored young people with rich parents. It was really something to do to pass the time. After COVID maybe they don't want to work there any more because they don't want to wear a mask all day, or they don't want to risk COVID or whatever.",8/2/2024,93,32,1707354035,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1alj3ai/what_is_with_the_short_opening_hours_in_malaysia/

Thoughts on shopee food,"I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment? Shopee food app is stupid hard to navigate though, maybe I just need that learning curve, so wanna get a sense of if its worth it before I commit to anything.

I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad for shopee food, it isn't, I've brought them to tribunal court for their shit delivery twice.","Always have used only Shopeefood. Cheaper and can use coins. The other two expensive lah || Shopee Food used to allow combination of 2 vouchers (1 for food discount, 1 for free/discount on delivery) which made is mad cheap! Now only 1 voucher is applicable || it's straight up shit.I understand if it is rainy or traffic holiday and no drivers can be found or not drivers wants to take the order. This is sunny day, no traffic and yet can't find any driver.

Praying for kerepok lekor comeback,"How come kerepok lekor I often eat nowadays not hot anymore? It's happened often at different stalls around Klang valley. And I buy between 2-4pm, no set time.

I used to always get freshly fried kerepok lekor growing up, you can smell it from afar and when you approach the stall the heat from all the fried stuff is radiating into your face.

My guess maybe not as much customer as before so whatever that's cooked sits stale for awhile. Y'all snacking at what bougie grab stall now? Or is everyone on the healthy food bandwagon?

I remember during COVID days I saw kerepok lekor in the frozen aisle and was so happy because never see my uncle kerepok lekor during those times. So nice to snack at home. Don't want to resort back to this :(","

I am of the opinion that the Sunway BRT line should be extended to KJ Line for reasons.,,"The BRT already has an interchange at KJL at USJ7 though.

My personal opinion is that it should be extended to IOI Puchong Jaya LRT via Puchong Legenda, which would offer a better connectivity from Puchong to Sunway without having to rely on the LDP. || I submit my proposal to the internet strangers to evaluate my plans for the extension. All routes starts at the bottom of the map near at the center. 

Option A Green Path: The BRT line will meander all the way through LDP to the KJ Station, stopping at 2 major residential areas that also includes a recreational park and a commercial center. It also stops at S3 right in front of Paradigm Mall, connecting Sunway Pyramid so they both have the traffic benefit. Problem is, you have to invest into a big infrastructure construction as you have to build elevated path along the highway.

Option B Cyan Path: The line will cut through a former industrial area at the bottom of the map but most of the lots are now bought by Sunway so they can reap the benefit of having a BRT line running through their property. It then goes to a big residential area where the catchment rate should be a bit bigger than the green path. It's also should be cheaper to build as it goes through a major road artery (Jalan Majlis) that isn't as busy as the LDP so the BRT lane can be build on the ground level, encouraging pedestrian traffic.

Option C Orange Path: The BRT line goes all the way to Subang Line instead to connect with Subang Airport Line for reasons.

That concludes my presentation. I will now accept my nomination to become one of the BODs of Prasarana and Sunway and get my monthly 5 figure salary in addition with the consultation fees. || Do we have a integrated map layover instead of the white background train map? Would be nice to see some context on how the tracks actually run || I use the lrt for work daily, never been on the brt. Is it usually busy/ crowded?

Please correct me if I get this wrong wrong. || I would do both, but mainly prioritize in extending it to the Puchong jaya LRT || Option C dont make sense.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive.

Experience with KL,"For context, I'm Singaporean and in June, I visited KL for the first  time.  I was in KL for 2 nights and I've only had the most pleasant experience there!

1. People were nice and pleasant. They were all smiles if I happen to meet their eyes. (in shops and strangers)
2. Traveling was smooth (I grabbed most of the time)
3. I dont care about the food rivalry between Singapore and Malaysia but I think Malaysia is really cooking something! (I REALLY love the food here)

I'm hoping to visit again next month, but i have questions like 

1. how can I get to know and make friends with locals.
2. hidden food spots (i think they call it warung/mamak)? I've only visited malls during my visit and wanted to try something more authentic and local.

also if there are any flags to look out for (if there are any)

I hope i can give me some suggestions and advice. Thank you in advance! 

&#x200B;","I’m so glad you haven’t asked the “IS IT SAFE” question your country men ask. || **Making local friends** \- try catching one of the weekend events or flea markets and talk to people with similar interests (e.g. music/ plants/ thrift/ tattoos). Alternatively, you can try visiting any art gallery because I always see people who go alone.

**Hidden food spots** \- there are plenty of good local eateries in Petaling Street. If you need more specific recommendations in terms of location or cuisine, do bring it up and we will try our best to suggest a few! || I highly recommend going to Klang. It's around one hour drive from KL and many KL people go there eat. Here's a list:

1) Famous steam lala from Boston Restaurant 
2) Bah Kut Teh is the best here (would recommend Ah Han if you like soupy and not so herbally soup but any shop will do, just make sure got ah pek sitting inside)
3) Reagent pandan layer cake (a bit expensive but it's nice)
4) Pao and dimsum stall at Kopitiam Ti Ee (only opens at night, quite famous and their big pao is the best) 
5) Yao Yao Bing Restaurant (fried chicken still acceptable but the drinks are nice)
6) Restoran I.V (famous for their roti canai, very crispy and nice, avoid coming on weekends)
7) Fruity Bakery and Cafe (famous for Apple Strudel, damm bloody good) 
8) Coconut Flower Seafood Restaurant (a quite far drive as it's deep inside but famous for toddy and crabs)
9) Port Klang Glutinous Rice Ball at Restoran Hoo Bee (it's a kopitiam and the stall only open at night) 
10) Kopitiam 33 Station ( lots of choice and the food there not bad, parking got but need to walk a bit)

This is based on what taste the best to me and any Klang people feel free to add on. Sorry for such a long comment 😅 || For 1, if you like art/ music/ vintage/ retro stuff then you might meet like minded people in REXKL. They have music events and flea markets sometimes, you can check out their instagram page. The people at the pop up flea markets are usually very knowledgeable and friendly.

Lots of good food spots in ICC Pudu and Petaling Street, where REXKL is also located nearby lol.  Assam laksa and lala meehoon in the area there is great. || I cant help you with item no. 1 cause i too am running in very small intimate circle. But i can probably help for no. 2.  

Mamak is everywhere, at every corner in every district. Warung is usually found farther out from tourist area  where locals hang out for heavy meals. 
Assuming you’re going to KL and probably be staying around the golden triangle, the nearest and most accessible mamak would be along Jln Ampang (NZ, Pelita). If youd like to experience warung (most open late noon till evening for dinner) you can try Kg Bharu. 

If you have specific locations or specific food you’d like to venture, maybe we could give more suggestions. || \> had the most pleasant experience

awww, golly, shucks, go on ....  *simulates boxing you on your arm* || Are you good looking? cuz people never smile at me :( || flea market sounds like my kind of thing! I will check it out!

PSA to all the abg² Grab yg acah² alim,"This message is NOT for all the hardworking and kindhearted abg² Grab.

This PSA is for those who think they're super alim and it's their moral obligation to educate people while delivering food.

This is not the 1st time it has happened to me, I usually just ignore it when it happens but seriously, I'm getting sick and tired of it.

Yes I'm a Muslim hence my very islamic name. That said, what I order and where I order should not concern you. If it affects your beliefs or principles, then please do cancel my order - no judgement from my side.

You failed to do your research. Yes, the restaurant I ordered from is a Chinese restaurant but it's run by a fully vegetarian family that's been that way for YEARS. In my personal opinion, they're even more strict with their food than muslims.

On top of not properly checking before giving your ""nasihat"", I did not appreciate the way you gave it. You were so arrogant when you called my name > asking me whether I know it's a Chinese restaurant > about to hint it's not Halal before I told you its a 100% vegetarian restaurant.

So please, if this PSA ever reach you - mind your own damn business. Thank you.

Sincerely,
A really sick and tired Malaysian.","Well, I've been waiting for this chance to share my experience. I'm a Muslim. I went to Ma'ahad (which is a school that combines academic & religion in your daily routine) for 5 years.

After I graduated. I went to work at these fruit shops which sell all kinds of drinks & foods based on fruit. Yes the owner is Chinese and for me a very good boss.

Okay here's the thing, one day I got an order from grab food and when the rider came to collect the order he noticed that I am Malay who is working in Chinese shops. Then he asked me: 

GF rider: ehh, kau melayu ke? Asal kerja kat sini. Dah takde kedai melayu ke kau nak kerja sini.

Me: haah bang, saya melayu.( I didn't respond to other questions)

GF rider: ni makanan kau buat ni halal ke? Customer ni orang melayu ni order.

Me: oh rojak ni 100% dari buah, so okay je kalau muslim nak makan.

GF rider: tak aku tanya makanan halal ke tak?! Aku bukan tanya ni rojak buah ke rojak apa?(with loud voice & rude attitude)

Me: ada buah tak halal ke bang? Setahu saya buah semua halal. Kalau abang tak nak amik order ni saya panggil rider lain.(we requested for another rider)

Then the rider was embarrassed & left the premises along with a few insults thrown at me and co-workers. Luckily there's no big fuss || Totally agreed on your point. I run a food stall too that sell cut fruits only but I’ve gotten call from customers that claimed that riders told them that the stall is Chinese run and “might” be not halal. || No digg, but I never get why Muslims are so critical/nosy of what their acquaintances and neighbours do.

I have fairly dark complexion which makes me look Malay, and I've been ""tegur"" by other riders when I'm eating in my car during puasa.

What the fuck mate? I'm not Malay, and it's none of your god damned business if I am. || There are a lot of chinese restaurant that cater to vegetarian and muslim customers. You just have to know which is which. Clearly the riders are more kmapung than some kampung people. My kampung's tok imam have no problem having breakfast at our local chinese kopitiam. || Lol Muslim around the world eat food made by non-muslim, especially made by vegetarians. Just as long as they don't have non-halal ingredients it's all good. Usually vegetable, eggs and fish are a non issue if there's no alcohol in it. How do they think muslim tourist eat in a non-muslim country? || I get you. I sometimes get some abang trying to preach and give unsolicited advice. Number 1, it's none of their business what I order. Number 2, *I'm not even Malay*. They just assume I am because I can speak fluently || Holier than thou attitude is bad. No matter from which race or religion || And this is why there's a green wave coming. Political Islam makes it their job to put their noses in others' affairs.

Malaysia needs to move back to a more laissez faire style of Islam ala pre-1990s.

The kind still practiced by Turkey, Indonesia, etc. || Cooked some chinese dish for my friend even try hard to make it halal like find replacement for chinese wine and ect(apparently can use white vinegar to replace it) then no one dare to eat i was like bro i half malay and i am muslim you think i want to feed yall pig is it? || YO I went throught same thing so this is what I did.

"Things To Do in Langkawi - I Love This Island Thank you, Malaysia!","I have just returned from a trip to Malaysia, (loved it) and one of my favourite places was Langkawi. 

So I wanted to share my thanks with this community and country with my 'mini trip report'. 

I saw a few people asking about it here, and I had the same problem myself, that most of the information online was outdated (before covid). 

It would have been good to know things like the ferry doesn't go to Penang anymore.

# Best Beaches in Langkawi

 

**Pantai Cenang: Popular Tourist Area**

 

**Pantai Tengah: Quiter Beach but lack of amenities nearby**

 

**Pantai Kok: A upscale beach area with a yachting marina**

 

**Tanjung Rhu: Quite Spot near the Kilim Geopark**

 

**Pantai Pasi Tengkorak: 'Skull Beach'**

&#x200B;

# How To Get to Langkawi

There are speedboats from Koh Lipe during the peak season months (November to April), and the ferry runs all year round from Kuala Perlis. It's best to book tickets in advance because they were fully booked when we arrived. The boat from George Town has been suspended since covid.

# How To Get Arround on Langkawi

Grab and Maxim both operate in Langkawi and it is very easy to arrange a ride anywhere, for a reasonable price. We also rented scooters so we can get around easier. Rental companies in Langawi and fair and there are plenty. The cost per day is 25 -35 MYR.

# Best Area To Stay in Langkawi

If it is your first time visiting Langkawi I highly recommend finding a place to stay in the Pantai Cenang area. This town is geared up to provide for tourists with a nice beach and lots of amenities, bars, restaurants. There are many scooter rental shops here so you can explore further, it cost 14 MYR for a Grab here from Kuah Pier.

# Favourite Place To Eat

We loved the food at Telaga Walk Food Market in Langkawi, obviosly ate a ton of Chicken Satay. And there was loads of Thai, Korean, Indian and Malay food. The spot is about a 5-10 walk away from the beach area, so it's pretty quiet.

# Things I Learned About Langkawi

**Langawi is Big**

I didn't realise how big the island was! 

**Langawi is Duty-Free**

The alcohol is cheap, I didn't realise it was duty-free at first and was shocked by the prices when we got to Penang. Why had the cost of a beer tripled!

**Phone Signal**

Be careful with data roaming in Langkawi, there were times when our phones would connect to Thailand!

**Monkeys**

There are loads of Monkeys roaming Langkawi island, they are mostly harmless and leave people alone, but keep a distance and don't let them see any food you have.

**ATM's**

I wasn't sure if there were ATMs on Langkawi, there weren't loads but there are enough dotted around. Especially in the tourist areas like Pantai Cenang

GrabFood and FoodPanda prices,"So title says it all. For reference I stay around the KL area, recently. So far this is the first time I've experienced it and was hoping someone else could explain it to me? 


Like it's been 2 weeks since the holidays, why is GrabFood practically either unavailable(like before this month when I opened GrabFood, I had a lot of choices) or the delivery prices are insane? FoodPanda isn't much better. More availability but the delivery prices are insane too. Someone please kindly explain to me whats going on so I can understand.","Also, noticed that PESTAPANDA voucher code doesn't seem to be working || Agreed that it’s mostly because of Eid but I’ve also been seeing a lot of false prices on delivery (i.e, showing that it’s RM4 on the page but then it’s RM9 when you checkout, even with the saver option).

What's a good monthly allowance budget for a University student?,"Malaysian University student. Lives at a hostel, even on weekends. Needs money for food, be it whatever eateries the University provides, Deliveries from restaurants via GrabFood, FoodPanda, etc., or just the convenience store. Maybe even needs money for laundry. Then, maybe they need to buy some equipment for their studies, say they need a camera or a new computer. What's a good budget for this student to get through the entire month?

Not including tuition fees, leisure activities, and any other unforeseen events that requires their money.","Man the way they teach math at school is useless... They should provide more real life questions like this.

Just my assumptions. Put into Excel spreadsheet and adjust according to own circumstances:

Hostel room with single person: RM600 (RM300-400 if sharing, RM1000 for more luxurious options)

Food: RM10 * 2meals * 30days =  RM600 
Filling snacks such as Milo and Biscuits budget = RM100
[Optional] occasional feast = RM200
Total = RM700 - 900

Utilities:
WiFi RM50
Electricity + water RM50
Mobile data RM50
Total = RM150


[Optional] Transport:
Parking = RM70
Fuel = RM60*2 refuels per month = RM120
Total = RM190, round to RM200 for safety



TOTAL:
Low: RM1350
Mid: RM1750
High: RM2250


I might have missed something. Just put into Excel sheet and edit as something comes to mind. Have some savings, and adjust excel sheet as expenses pop up. Reduce expenses if income not enough to support.

I assume you're asking for your kid, if so remember to consider if your kid travels back to hometown to meet you. If yes, need to consider in budget and maybe increase a bit for kid to have more leeway in spending. Ask him to report his spending and adjust spreadsheet if you're worried your kid bazir. Use the spreadsheet to find any suspicious spending. Budget using highest expected spending. Always budget enough, don't budget expecting to skip a meal or something. || I got 750 allowance monthly , but I save by doing laundry at my parents house , going back at weekends the occasional gas refill by them so I extrapolate roughly to 1.2k. Should say my location is Bangi. || For me, food alone is RM30 a day with a bit of leeway to go a bit higher or lower(Not more or less than RM5). This is only possible because I eat 2 times a day and I make sure I eat heavy enough to not lose or gain weight.

Basically, what I do is buy food from the closest Uni eateries and pay 8-12 for my first meal and 20-25 for grab food for my second meal.   Have to be smart to pick food from Grab to get the bang for my buck portion wise.

So, that's roughly RM900 a month.

IF other things like leisure stuff and necessary self maintenance stuff included, maybe 1200-1300 all together. || Hah like that , 900 enough ? Can cook your own food ? I live with 600 including rental in 2014 to 2022 || Lives at Nilai Sep - Jan 22/23, rent + bills utilities around 200 per months. Do the cooking by my own under 250. || [deleted] || You should first remove one off purchase for monthly allowance budget (phone/camera/computer).

Depending on lifestyle for food which will account of majority of expense (since hostel I assume is paid before the beginning of the semester).

Break it down to simple categories:  
Food : 2 x 15 x 30 = RM900  
Phone bill : RM50  
Entertainment (cause they are in uni, let them have fun ) : RM1000  


RM2k a month is a good amount. I used to get this as my monthly stipend when I was in uni between 2011-2015 and it was enough for me, granted I live with my parents. Not sure what the lifestyle of uni students partnered with inflation now is like but it's a safe enough amount. || RM1,500 to RM1,800 depending on the location.

edit: these figures are based on YOUR description above, the kind of lifestyle that you chose to have. || 3-4k is ok lah || If this does not include any school events, rent or utilities. 800-1200 is enough if the person aims to save and reduce cost. Let's assume the person aims to only eat on average 1.5x outside and 1.5 xat their hostel/home. Food alone would be 350-450riggit. Laptop, phone bills (only need 1 new laptop and phone for duration of study) average out 200 ringgit 4years. Entertainment/other expenses, 100-200. Transport (varies alot 150-400).

Unless there's government enforcement, companies like Grab will go with the easiest path to get your money even at the expense of security. 

For example, if you go to an online site that accepts Grab as a payment method, the token they generate remains accessible to that site which means if that site gets breached, someone using that token could make payments using your account. 

Grab makes no effort to give you the tools to easily view or revoke those tokens through the app. || Don’t link or save any card details on app. Don’t trust them for security reasons || You most likely have some malware or dodgy Apps in your phone. Mind to list all your apps, we want to know what’s the app that is suspicious? || You can't transfer money without any user input or revealing/scanning QR codes.

I transfer a small amount of money each time i need to auto-topup or topup my grab wallet or other ewallets, etc so even if I lose my money, I lose only what is limited in the Rize bank account.  


So I get convenience but no risk (other than losing the full amount in my Rize bank) which I limit what I transfer, and its not my main bank account. You can try that approach as well if you're worried in future this happens. Your case seems unusual and never heard of Payer Max. One possibility is with grab you can use another machine to key in your phone number and 6 digit grab pin but for first time it usually requests for OTP to verify but there's a possibility that the previously authenticated browser was not cleared (maybe you used it on someone else's phone or an internet cafe, etc).

Government agency / website to make a complaint about a business (and make sure that I can get a refund)?,"**Some background on the problem I'm facing:**

I recently made an order (slightly over RM100) through an online platform that serves as a middleman for small/medium (family-owned) food merchants / businesses.

Shortly after I messaged by the food merchant about my order (I was in contact with them earlier, asking them about allergen issues in their products, so they already had my number) and was told that the online platform (the business itself, the website is still working and all) doesn't seem to be in operation anymore - the merchant had been trying to reach them by email/telephone for the latter half of 2022 but no one responded.

I also went to check on the social media pages (FB and IG) of the online platform and the last posts were in August 2022. There were also comments on there asking whether they were still operational.

I had purchased from this platforn believing that it was OK because my sister had previously bought some stuff through them and had no issues (this was back in late 2021). but now I think I might have been scammed. I tried to initiate a refund to my Grab wallet (as I had used that payment method) but Grab support told me that I had to contact the online platform directly.

**My question:**

Is there a government agency / department that I can file a report / complaint to regarding this issue, and hopefully get back my money?","iirc for cases below RM5k you can go to Mahkamah Majistret/small claims court. You can represent yourself, no need lawyer. || \> Grab wallet (as I had used that payment method)

You made a grave mistake here. Something you need to learn. If you have an inkling of suspect of a seller, always use a credit card to make payment. All it take is a simple call, and my credit card provider will handle everything. No need for middleman like grab, tng and duit now. Credit card is the only safest payment option. Just last month i reverse charges of nearly 10k just by calling the provider. || thanks for the advice. I'll definitely consider this avenue. || good point. thanks for this valuable advice. I would have done that, but I trusted that this company wasn't doing any funny business (as mentioned - my sister had purchased through them before, and had no issues).

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Not asking for any sightseeing tips or makan places :DMods: I would've chucked this in the daily thread but thought it might be a good resource for others.

Edit: Yes i did read the FAQ/Wiki

Money

* Of course cash is king but how common is it to use credit cards at a 7/11 or food court?
* Also is Apple Pay a thing in KL?

Travel

* Is the go-to navigation app Waze? I'm used to Google maps.
* How do I get a touch n go smart tag thingy (?) for tolls and such as I'm going to be hiring a car.
* Best way out of KLIA? Taxi or pre-booked car?
* Grab over cabs right? Any other competitors to use?

Covid

* I see MySejahtera is no longer compulsory. Does anyone still check?
* Is masking up still expected?

Any other handy tips to make things smoother just getting around and doing stuff day-to-day? Thanks and apologies if anything questions seem dumb.","Must always carry toilet paper on yourself ‼️ || Within the Klang Valley, CC is pretty widespread. Living here I have like 50MYR emergency cash, everything else I would use either CC or eWallets(tng/grab/boost)

Apple Pay was just introduced a few months back, I do use them, but some terminals for some reason are quite buggy with ApplePay (i.e. parkings sometimes you have to tap twice)


Go-to is waze, but gmaps is good too.

Within Klang Valley, tng you can get at major train stations or tng offices. Iirc watson no longer attaches tng to their new memberships, but some might carry old membership cards with tng. Dont expect to get the new NFC card. Only get smart tag jf you would be driving around, even then, for long stay, might be better to get RFID since the smart tag lanes are quite long.

Best way out of KLIA is train.

Always use grab over taxis. Some taxis do drive grabs, but thats ok since the payments system wont cheat you.

Mysejahtera is only checked when you are positive covid.

Masking ruling is no longer there, but, most people still wear masks indoors. || Cards with pay wave are the most common forms of payment in Malaysia. Along with Touch N Go e-wallet at food courts.

Waze is for driving, for public transport and walking use Google maps.

Best way out of KLIA is the train.

Apple pay is accepted anywhere credit and debit cards are accepted. So very common. || Masking in public transport and those grab/taxi is still a thing(compulsory by law) || While CC and eWallets are getting very commonplace in the Klang Valley, most kopitiams and hawker stalls still prefer cash. I’d recommend still bringing enough to cover a meal for your family! 

Grab is pretty much the main option for e-hailing. Some cabs also use Grab to find riders. There are others like InDriver but they’re much less common. 

Bring tissue paper with you. It’ll also double up as toilet paper 😂 || (1) 7/11 yes. Food courts accept debit/credit card (and PayWave-based e-wallets) only in malls. Kopitiams still cash.

(2) Credit/debit cards and PayWave-based e-wallets widely accepted in places that have indoor air-condtioning.

(3) Waze widely used but use what you like, used Gmaps before, works fairly well.

(4) Mass transit is a lot better than when you left, Anthony Loke in charge now so it will just get better. Might not even have to hire a car. TNG thingy available at TNG KL Sentral (most convenient for you) : Lot L2.07, Level 2, Nu Sentral Shopping Mall, No. 201 Tun Sambanthan, 50470, Kuala Lumpur.

(5) Depends on what you mean by best : ERL train ($$, comfortable, fast) or Airport Bus ($), Ride-hailing ($$$, most convenient and comfortable), car hire.

(6) Grab over cabs always. Another major player is AARide. Few smaller players (Maxim etc.)

(7) No one checks anymore, unless you look visibly sick.

(8) Mask not required now but many people wear one out of concern for others. || Paywave in Kl is widely adapted. Apple pay and Google wallet just enter the market. Still sucks but its working now. I used Samsung pay since the last 4 years. no problem. Still some small2 shop/tepi jalan shop prefer cash. A lot has adopted cashless payment nowadays.

Waze has been bough by google. Its working the same. You can use google maps without problem in Malaysia ages ago.

No more smart tag. Still can get 3rd party seller Max Tag. Its compatible. Anyway TNG card can use lots of places. From travel to payment. We also have TNG Ewallet thingy.

Covid restriction is no more. Free roam nowadays. || Money: Apple Pay is used but I'm not sure how many vendors accept it. Touch n go ewallet is much more common and accepted in most places. In my daily life, I hardly ever use cash since most places use qr payment.

Travel: KLIA express is cheapest and most convenient imo. But you can get grab or taxi at the airport if you want to go straight to your destination and don't want to transit at kl sentral.

Traveling to Johor Bahru. What to take note?,"So, I am an Singaporean PR from Jakarta. I have been wanting to go to JB for a solo day trip and would like to have some advice. Particularly on public transport in the city, where to visit, covid rules and local payment.

Things I already know and prepare are:

1. Avoid traveling across during weekends for obvious reason.
2. Getting to JB. I find this article on every bus route from SG to JB. ([https://businterchange.net/johorbus/tips/221-going-to-johor-bahru-via-woodlands](https://businterchange.net/johorbus/tips/221-going-to-johor-bahru-via-woodlands)). Planning to go through Causeway link or SBS bus so  I considering getting ManjaLink card. ManjaLink also seems to be used for JB local travel by Causeway link so it seems to be a good idea to get one.
3. Since I am from Jakarta, I am familiar with pick pocket and how to keep safe from it. Though, it has been a while since I went back to Jakarta.
4. I got a YouTrip card so PayWave payment shouldn't be an issue. Though, probably still need cash.
5. I got a Vaccination certificate from [Notarise.gov.sg](https://Notarise.gov.sg) and ususally kept spare masks just in case.
6. I have TPG/Simba card with 1GB of roaming in Malaysia which should be enough for day trip.
7. Bus seems to also be preferred public transport though, only Causeway Link have contactless payment. Grab also an option of course.

Now for the questions?

1. Should I make currency exchange in Singapore or Malaysia? Which money changer you recommend for either case?
2. Is there a QR payment system in Johor that allow receiving/top-up money from either PayWave or Singapore banks?
3. Any local traditional food place to recommend?
4. Edit: How safe biking in Johor? I got a 3sixty foldie. Can it go inside the local public bus?","As a sinkie that goes to Jb semi often, 

1. Forget about public transport, just grab everywhere since its a day trip and the prices are in ringgit (similar to sg but divide by 3). Don't waste your precious 1 day time waiting for transport.

2. And no, please don't bring your bike unless it's a biking event, it's not bike friendly.

3. Regarding the vaccination thingy, well, no one checks for it now, even the customs people cannot be bothered. Good to have it prepared but no one seriously cares about it now.

4. Shopping malls will take visa but cash is very important for the mamak stores and the various small massage places which dont use them. 

5. If you don't need to change a lot, the CIQ itself will have money changers for a rate of 3.3 at a minimum of 100 SGD changed.

6. Some merchants also take Favepay, which your Google Wallet can use to scan for QR payments. || Heres a how to get to JB[how to get to johor bahru guide](https://yourjbhood.com/how-to-get-to-and-around-johor-bahru/) you may find handy. || 3. Kacang pool haji, probably overrated but idk, i love it cos it’s weird.

4. Not safe at all to ride a bicycle in JB. || As for 2, some Malaysian e-wallets do accept Singapore cards for reloads, like Touch n Go. You can just reload any desirable amount to the ewallet and use them for any transaction from vendors that has a blue TnG/pink Duitnow QR logos. || If you're worried about the traffic on the Bridge, you could look into KTM Shuttle Tebrau to and fro JB. From my experience, the train and immigration checkpoint at the station are 
less of a hassle than the bus. || Honestly, I still would like to try the public bus just out of curiosity. Comparing it with Singapore and Jakarta. Obviously, JB is a smaller city than either so makes sense that the bus network is considerably smaller from what I read online.

Also, I presume Malaysia doesn't have motorcycle taxi, right? || As someone who’s lived in that city before, I would highly discourage you from wasting your precious time trying out the public bus - heck I would even say the same for public buses in KL. The main issue is with the frequency and quality of transit, both of which are absymal in this country. || KL public buses are fine, they all have live tracking on the Google maps app.",31/10/2022,6,8,1667205852,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/yi58bo/traveling_to_johor_bahru_what_to_take_note/

First day in Malaysia and this happened,"Me and my gf just arrived in KL yesterday. We got hungry at night, so we decided to grab some meals at a fast food restaurant at KL Sentral station.

It was around 10:15 pm, people were still queuing up. I was talking with my gf and suddenly I heard the staff yelling at some customers saying, “Close close.” with some gestures telling a group of customers behind me to go away.
I find it very rude of them.

Happened twice, and then another customers came in and tried to order, the staff served them nicely.
And another group of customers came in and got their order.

I was like, “wtf?”

Then I realized that the group of customers the staff yelled at were Indian people.
The ones they accepted were local Malay and Chinese.
But, the thing is, the staff was Indian as well.

We’re confused, can someone explain to me what’s going on?

Thanks!","Nah. We don't do that here. Unless maybe a troublesome or drunk group? Sometimes the same old gang keep giving troubles, so they chase them away. || Sounds like an actually interesting midnight snack story. Maybe there were a rowdy group || maybe those groups are infamous around the area? || Probably you need to ask them what's going on lol. || probably had a disagreement about something lah, maybe wanted to sit in a closed section, or wanted something not available on the menu. close close was just telling them to piss off, after arguing about it. still not a great way of dealing with it, but i doubt race had anything to do with it, as in they're expressly turning away Indian customers.

McD's? KFC? || Very likely they close at 10.30pm or 11pm. They already count how many orders they can take before the kitchen close. 

From what i read complaints from those that work in the f&b industry, 1 thing they hate most are customers that come near closing time. || Tell me you went to get roti.   I missed those roti midnight snacks. || Mebbe they wanted pok! || My guess would be that the group that were told to go away are most likely Bangladeshis and there seems to be some sort of misunderstanding between them and the staff. So, the staff figured it'd be easier to simply tell them it's approaching closing time.

Generally speaking, among all the foreigners working in Malaysia, Bangladeshis are somehow the most hated/least respected by the locals. || 
Ok I know I would be downvoted but the racial stereotype in Malaysia goes like this:

Malay are the lazy bunch 
Chinese are the money grabbing greedy bunch 
Indians are the alcoholic bunch 

The fear is that Indians would get so drunk, and too drunk to pay, but even worse is they would have drunken fighting, disturbing other patrons. 

To be honest, if I’m going out for a late supper with my spouse and I saw Indians there drinking, I would just drive away. If I’m being alone I don’t mind watching some shit show but if my spouse is tagging along then I wouldn’t want to take the risk.",9/9/2022,17,16,1662731488,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/x9w3ev/first_day_in_malaysia_and_this_happened/

Menu Price Difference on GrabFood,"So, recently I noticed that the menu  items of a particular restaurant are different by ~RM3-RM4 on GrabFood compared to their in-store price. The thing is they explicitly mentioned that the prices are same as in-store on their menu page in GrabFood. I did saw a post similar to this in this subreddit. However, can anyone please tell what can be done regarding this? Is there somewhere we can report this?","There will always be a difference. Nobody will do a business where they lose money, Grab takes 31.8% off of everything in the menu, so if a restaurant sells for the same price as in store, they will be losing 31.8% of profit plus plastic for takeaway packaging. 

The easiest way is to not use their service unless really really have to. One pandemic and they think they're an unstoppable service/business. Let them think otherwise || Try to use food delivery services only if you’re in desperate situations. Otherwise, do takeaway or dine-in. || https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-my/900004330283-Why-is-the-item-price-different-from-In-store || Platform fee yo.

He’s talking about cases where the price is stated to be same in-store when it’s not.

Situations like this happen because some shops (advised by Grab onboarding team i guess) specifically print a separate menu just for Grab verification purposes. Or specify different prices on their menu just for takeaway/delivery. Or have special bundles just for delivery while not selling individual, cheaper, items.

There are a lot of tricks and loopholes they’re using to get away with displaying “prices are same as in store”.

I'm thinking about moving out of KL for less dense areas. Which small city is the best?,"I (30 M) have had enough of the 'urban lifestyle'. I can't take the constant road construction, traffic jams, loud-ass Grab/FoodPanda bikes and constant badgering from my colleagues insisting on 3-hour physical meetings when things can be sorted out with emails. 

FYI I work as a Web3 writer. I've been mulling about this for 2 years now. Currently I'm juggling a full time job and a remote writing job. The remote job pays higher than the FT job. And the workload is lower. So I'm thinking about resigning from the FT job, getting another remote writing gig and moving out of KL for small cities with good Internet coverage (preferably Unifi). 

My wife and I have no strong attachment to any cities or states (though I kinda like Taiping). As long as the area have Unifi coverage, we're pretty much set on our way. So which less dense cities/daerah/mukim (besides Taiping) would you recommend us?","Depends on what kind of conveniences that you cannot do without. Unifi availability at larger towns, like Taiping, is a given but be aware that depends on which housing area you're staying at since speed at some of the housing areas could be throttled due to the number of switches for that area could be limited and thus, lower average speeds. That does not mean you don't get the speed you signed up for as you will still get the spikes of speed to what you signed up for but the sustained rates are low.

Somewhat similar to Taiping is Muar, Johor. Do note that Muar is more prone to flooding than Taiping since it is located at the river mouth of Sungai Muar that empties into the Straits of Malacca. Will need to take that into account with the worsening climate situation. There are 2 other towns in Johor worth considering as well - Batu Pahat and Kluang. Batu Pahat is a larger version of Muar. It is set slightly further back from the coast but is built-up around the Sungai Batu Pahat. Kluang is further inland like Taiping.

If you don't mind a larger place, my hometown of Ipoh may be considered although prices are slowly creeping up towards KL prices. If you don't plan to regularly travel to the city centre, you can avoid a lot of the congestion as the suburbs and outskirts are relatively self-sustaining and even have their respective shopping malls. For example, there are 3 Aeon Malls in Ipoh and located in the Ipoh Garden suburb, Menglembu suburb, and Klebang outskirts of Ipoh.

For an out-of-the-box location, you may want to consider Pulau Langkawi. Duty-free island. Idyllic. Prices of dailies would be closer to KL due to transportation costs but otherwise, foreign imported goods are duty-free. || Seremban lei...got nothing,so peaceful..got unifi also. || kota kinabalu or kuching. I would try either this too. No experience staying there but i know a tech company has a team in KK. Visited my friend in Kuching, my impression educated abroad young adults who choose to remain there, i guess the city will offer some different experience there. Sorry lacking the right vocab to describe properly, hope you get what i mean 😅 || Tanjung Malim. Not that far from KL. Not that far from Ipoh. Very very quiet. Population of trainee teachers, palm oil farmers, and pensioners. Got Unifi and Yik Mun Pau || Kuantan lol || Putrajaya || Try Janda Baik/Bukit Tinggi in Pahang. It’s more of a settlement than a town. Buy land there and build a house. Unifi is available but only at selected areas.

It’s a really beautiful place nestled within rolling hills shrouded in morning mists. Lots of good food and morning markets selling fresh produce. The weather is cool and the air is crisp. 

For amenities it’s just a 30 minute drive to KL but it’s isolated enough to feel separated from the larger Klang Valley conurbation. || Kuching 100% || If I choose to escape this urban hell that is KL, I'd probably move to Langkawi or Pangkor. I love island/beach life. || I love Taiping too. One of the towns I've shortlisted for my retirement.

How much should I be giving,"Fellow Malaysians,

With the current economy and the job insecurity, how much do you pay your parents?

I am currently earning net RM5.2k. (approx figure), but cannot seem to satisfy my mom. I have PTPTN debt and that’s it. I do not have a car or a place myself. Currently renting a place in KL while my parents are both doing small businesses in hometown (Ipoh). 

Every time I call my mom, all she talk about is how I should be supporting them more, how I should save my money and not spend so much on myself, etc.

Bear in mind, my current expenses usually revolves around parents pocket money (300-500/month), sports (300/month), food (1,000-1,200/month), rent (1,000/month), other bills (300/month) and almost nothing else. Perhaps monthly entertainment at most RM1,000*. Also, my job is very demanding (work from 9AM-2AM daily). Hence, I usually have to grab food/tapao. 

* This might include things like buying an office chair, sometimes hair cut, sometimes could be sports item, etc. I don’t drink/smoke/go to cinema/do any sorts of other entertainment, besides my sports.

I’m not sure if I am a big spender right here, I really don’t know. But I feel like I am not? And it just annoys me that every time I call my mom, she nags me about saving money and tell me to support them more. 

So the question now is,
1. How much do you earn and how much of it is used to pay parents? Please also indicate if you stay with your parents (rental is not easy).
2. Honestly, tell me if I am a big spender?


EDIT: Just to be clear, entertainment here also includes sports wear, work wear, skincare, shoes, physio treatment (unfortunately I do extreme sports so I have to go for physio monthly), facial, subscriptions, sometimes overspent weekend dinner, monitor (for my wfh setup), massage, etc.

EDIT 2: 5.2k is net y’all. Gross is 6+. I also earn claims occasionally if I work in clients place (which is rare these days). As such, minimum savings is 1k, will increase if i’ve claims.","Keep your conversations short and bi-weekly, to monthly. You're an adult, your well being comes first.

 Some eldery people have old fashion toxic mindsets, we can't change them, but can take steps to minimise nonsense.

It's your money, you are in control of it. || Sorry to say, but I think that parents demanding pocket money is already a sign of an unhealthy relationship.

If I'm bringing a human to this world, do I expect him to look after me when I'm old? He didn't ask to be born. Plus, for how long will I be able to force him to come see me and pay for me? There's also the modern realities of life, where its very difficult for the average Malaysian to afford a home, car, family, etc. Why even decide to have children in the first place if so many things are stacked against them having a decent life?

To me, a healthy relationship should be one filled with love, where the parent puts no expectation on the child to look after him and the child wants to look after the parent by choice. Everyone should try to live up to this ideal. || Wait..you're working for  17 hours daily? Is this for real? I can't comment on the 1st question but for the 2nd one...I think you're fine. I guess your food expenditure is a bit high but that could be reasonable possibly since you tapau food daily...Anyways your weight to height ratio is normal...It's kinda toxic that your mother thinks this way. Maybe you could talk to her about this if it's disturbing you mentally. || On top of these finances comments, she also constantly tell me that I am fat? I am 66kg, 168cm - female. She constantly ask me to stop eating meaty/cheesy food when I’ve been eating salad daily and doing sports 3-4 times/week. It’s killing me to talk to her. || I cant help but bringing gender into this. 

I was guessing you are most likely a female based on the fact that your mum is stressing out not giving enough and constantly criticize your lifestyle and body.  

Just cant imagine mum doing the same to her son. Maybe something for you to think about. || She needs to understand that 5k in 2022 especially in KL really isn't a lot. You're still able to spend on yourself because you don't have a car. Imagine if you had a car; monthly installment, petrol, tol, maintenance, rtax/insurance... then you'd be eating gardenia, maggi and economy rice every single day. Maybe something nice on the weekends. Hell, most of the time I'm in Ipoh and my spending on food is around RM30-50/day. Weekends lain kira (dining out, booze, massage, etc.). 

So I can't say if you're a big spender, but you always have a choice; make M40 money, live a B40 lifestyle. Save half of your paycheck, live on the other half. It's what I used to do, but not anymore lol. Ultimately it's totally up to you. || Sorry to say but your mum is displaying serious narcissistic behaviour. I get it that she is your mum but that doesn’t mean that you should tolerate such toxic behaviour. If it’s an option maybe you can speak to your dad about this? You can let him know that your mum is putting a lot of pressure on you, tell him as it is you are working 17 hours a day so you definitely not need this added pressure. 

And some friendly advice for the future - maybe it’s best not to disclose your salary to your parents. 5.2k may sound alot to parents from a small town like Ipoh because they may not be able to comprehend the high cost of living in KL. 

And also…never ever feel guilty for spending your hard earn money on yourself (sports, entertainment or otherwise) otherwise you will suffer from serious burnout and resent work. 

All the best to you! || I don't give my parents money. I insisted but they told me they are well off and i should invest into my future. But i treat the whole family to dinner at a fancy restaurant once a month || Y don’t you flip it ? Every day, when your parents call, complain about your job, pay cut, after a few months say u lost your job need to find another job. (Plan wisely what to say, when to say) tell her new job pay sucks, lower pay longer hours, feeling remorse, bla bla bla.
Unable to survive much like the previous job. But hope you all are ok. It’s not being selfish but you have to take care of yourself also. Keep giving what you give. To her.. if She ask have you eaten or something. Just say not hungry. U need to show negative. || Ngl i do feel like you're quite a big spender, but it probably is partly due to the amount of work and stress you deal with (thus wanting to spend to destress?). But regardless of what i say, to each of their own.

https://maps.app.goo.gl/4vUzDVbN6U6fRpKA9 || What are your opinions about Malaysian food compared to our neighboring countries like Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia? Being someone who travelled extensively around this region, I think you would have the chance to sample each country's unique cuisine.

No one ask for it, but here's my take anyways. The variety of food in Malaysia is probably the widest in SEA, mostly due to the fact we are a multicultural society rather than an assimilated one like Indonesia, Thailand or Vietnam. Their food is excellent, but it's more focused and narrow. 

The closest comparison to Malaysia is obviously Singapore. However, Singapore's local cuisines are only comparable to what we have in Malaysian urban areas (Standard stuff like Nasi Lemak, Char Kuey Teow etc.). What they do not get to experience is the crazy variety of food options from the East Coast and Borneo. || Food =

1. Nasi Lemak
2. Durian (Durian season is coming next month or two.)

CMV: 2022 Bazar Ramadan is not worth it,"I went to the bazaar in Kampung Baru and a few other places in KL. It was too crowded which increased the risk of getting Covid. The food was decent at best and I didn't find anything that made me wanna buy it again. The food was also overpriced with small portions or worst, made with the bare minimum ingredients. People say that we should support the local hawkers as the economy is bad, but honestly, I don't think they deserve it.

TLDR: Bazaar food is not worth it. You're better off cooking yourself or order from Grab/ Foodpanda.","Agreed, it seems to be a nightmare waiting to happen... In all honesty, I have gotten better results getting my kuih, murtabak etc from restaurants that have their own sort of ""mini bazaar"" since they actually have a reputation to uphold.

Im a new student in Malaysia and i have some questions,"hello! as the title suggests im very new to Malaysia so i wanted to make a detailed post to figure out my way around here. i hope you guys can help, please! 

I need to know some specific stuff. 
(online store suggestions are welcome too)

1) where should i get groceries and other daily-use stuff as a student on a budget?

3) is Giant hypermarket suitable for getting all sorts of stuff from affordable pots and pans, to basic groceries? What alternatives are available? 

4) what are some good places to get Indian/Pakistani food in Subang esp Sunway? (foodpanda/grab/in-person)

if you have any other tips/suggestions/advice/recommendations that could make my adjustment easier, please do share.

If there's anyone who lives/lived in Subang Jaya and is willing to guide me some more, I'd really appreciate it if you reach out to me through the inbox. :)

edit: removed some questions","1. Any local convenience store such as 99 SpeedMart, KK mart should be enough to cover most of your dry foods(breads, biscuits, noodles) and some wet foods(vegetables and meat). For better coverage can visit Giant, Tesco/Lotus or Aeon for budget friendly prices. 

2. Giant, Aeon, Mydin and Tesco are all hypermarkets, they should cover all of the things you mentioned in Q2. 

3. For Indian/Pakistani food, I always go to House of Pakeeza. It is at Petaling Jaya near Digital Mall. They serve Northern Indian/Mughals cuisine, they are very good. Foodpanda and GrabFood are good when you don’t feel like cooking their delivery can be quite expensive. 

Tips to live in Malaysia

a. Don’t use taxi, they will rip you off. Use Grab to get your ride. 

b. Get a Touch N Go card, you will use it when you use public transport. If you plan to drive soon, you will need it for tolls and parking. 

c. Try out all our foods, we are a multiracial country we have all sort of good food you can imagine. 

Lastly, welcome to Malaysia 😄 || [removed] || depends where you are from in Subang. Giant, Aeon Big and Mydin are pretty cheap/affordable when it comes to groceries. If you want something online and convenient, Shopee grocery is good, decent quality and price. just need to make sure you are at home to receive it. || 99 speed mart sell groceries at the decent price , slightly cheaper than supermarket, or else if you want even cheaper options you can look for any 2 dollar shop if there's any near your location.

For affordable pots and pans again you can try look for them at 2 dollar stores , or if there are any MR DIY near your place, it's also a good place to look for affordable pots and pans , utensils anything you can name. 

Try local mamak restaurants if you are looking for affordable Indian food. Sorry that's all I know because I don't venture outside of that(typical Chinese dude here) but they very affordable if that's what you are looking for. || 1. 99 Speedmarts. But really any marts nearby should suffice, some could be Tesco, Giant, AEON, Mydin, Jaya Grocer, Hock Choon, etc. But it's possible your Uni within its dorms could have its own convenience store.
2. Alternatives are Tesco, AEON, but some people really like Mr. DIY or DAISO for their prices. Daiso is a bit too small but perfect for single people.
3. Hmmm, this is something I'm not familiar with especially in the pandemic with several being closed down. Also been a long time since I've been in Sunway. Sorry.

Hmm, whichever restaurant filled with customers would always be a good choice.

But this does not include healthy choices. Dorms would have various restrictions but their food is more healthy than elsewhere. If you're not living in dorms, then it's imperative to cook your own dishes (some of the time).

There are ""FamilyMart"" around but I find the food twice more expensive compared to AEON food. It is very tasty...

When living with other people and sharing space with them...label all your food.

The heat and humidity in Malaysia is said to be very unbearable to foreigners so invest in some rechargeable desk fans or smaller portable fans (the smaller it is, the more expensive it is for good quality fans)

The road app to get in Malaysia is WAZE.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=US)

But they have not been updating hazards recently like the recent floods...

Unfortunately there is not a single better alternative app at the moment. But you can try Google Maps.

You should look into where the closest clinics and hospitals are, in case anything happens. || Can only guess you're in Taylor's, Monash or Sunway U. Therefore:

1) Groceries with budget: 99speedmart, mydin, aeon big.

3) Personally, I don't recommend Giant. More choices at Aeon Big. More down to earth ingredients at Mydin. Get equipment from aeon big or Mr diy. Or spoil yourself with shopee/Lazada or ikea. 

4) Food? Join your foreign student society/club in uni. They'll hook you up to authentic homemade food. I'm looking for affordable authentic Pakistani tandoori myself (best I had was in the town of Nilai 3, state of Negeri Sembilan.

Being foreign food, Pakistani and North Indian food is priced as higher than usual.

Regardless, in Subang, I recommend you explore your main malls and areas.
Malls: Sunway Pyramid, Subang Parade, AEON Big, Main Place, and the areas of USJ Taipan, and SS15.

You might find the night life there pleasing. || It's not difficult to go out and explore your surroundings on your own. That is how to learn more about any country you're in and the people.  

Don't expect everyone to spoon feed you information.  

Like another person mentioned, another way is to ask your other international classmates. || 1) speedmart, mydin as your initial ones, then check other big and small. For instance each have their advantage and disadvantage comparing big and small stores. For instance i found that the cheapest sliced cheese cost less at a local shop than bake with yen.  
2) no giant actually is pricey. i used to buy from giant only to find out that its actually pricey and over a year was more significant.

3) please try the local cuisine. I always critique this. WHen i was overseas i ate the local food as it was cheaper and better. Indian, mamak and pakistani restaurants here charge you a lot and mamak here rarely give quality food. Instead there are many small stands in the morning that sell food really cheap that is very good, and there are local restaurants that sell malaysian food real cheap. For instance near where i work just within a stones throw i can get any rice + stuff for rm6. I could have pulut kuning with beef rending for rm6. These places exist that serve cheap and good food but they are only local food and you have to find them (you can ask others as well).  


when i went to the UK i ate like a british. less rice, more potatoes, bread, cheese and meat. I kept it simple, inexpensive and healthy so this saved time. || Dont eat seafood at local mamak tho, the price enter another realm aka kayangan. || You make it seem like we don't live in pandemic times...",22/12/2021,21,24,1640173200,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/rm3heg/im_a_new_student_in_malaysia_and_i_have_some/
A Monyet Sees: Budak Kripto (2021),"**TLDR:** Budak Kripto goes further than being a trash cash-grab movie, it is a willfully done work of malicious 'cinema' aimed at taking advantage of Finas’ Protectionist Laws, ironically made to protect Malaysian films to begin with.

https://preview.redd.it/kgvame62ja181.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cfd8c57a88a8bcc322621b8bc915eaf34f4f713

Hello again monyets. Recently a movie came out that made me question the integrity of our protectionist laws, most notably Finas’ [Skim Wajib Tayang](https://www.finas.gov.my/en/services/wajib-tayang/), or in English Mandatory Screening Scheme. The joke of course is integrity + Malaysian bureaucracy, but this really reached a new low to me and since no one is talking about it I thought I would.

Now, you don’t need me to tell you this movie is garbage. Hell, even the [comments on Budak Kripto's trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD2RZl0kpAg) itself is full of people in agreement that this is terrible. But see, that's easy- it's too simple to just cry hUrR dUrR mOvIe bAd omegalul. What I wish to highlight is a different perspective- what does such garbage coming on the silver screen mean for Malaysian cinema?

**The Big Deal about Crypto**

https://preview.redd.it/lnhx49n8ja181.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbbd44f5bb54a6ec14cf45ea472428d8bd3bcf19

Today, it seems that there is no mystery that better encapsulates the curiosity and wonder of technology than cryptocurrency. What is cryptocurrency? How is this small block of code worth tens of thousands of dollars? Who created it, and why? Is it real? But perhaps most importantly to creatives, can we make a story out of it?

For many of the marginalized and downtrodden, cryptocurrency floats above like an unreal specter. It is the light at the end of the tunnel, the deus ex machina able to lift them from financial destitution. Oscar Wilde might have said that life imitates art far more than art imitates life, but little did he know that some 132 years later after putting pen to paper, a Malaysian movie would come out to prove him wrong. This is the case of art imitating life, but in a way so shallow and immaterial that it leaves you wondering how such a thing even made it on the silver screens.

**A 'Plot' Summary**

Budak Kripto is a movie about the down on his luck Putra (played by Zam Azmi), who flees debt collectors after having been scammed from a gold investment scheme some time prior. Through a fortuitous circumstance, he meets Bro Mus (played by Fahrin Ahmad), a businessman looking to sell people on a new cryptocurrency- [NP Coin](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Finance/npcforyou/posts/) (I'll get to this later). Through hard-work and determination, they make the business work, and Putra meets the lovely Mira (played by Nurul Hida).

The rest of the movie happens through unbelievably lazy usage of flashback footage (15 minutes worth), unbelievably serendipitous happen stances (loan sharks keep finding him somehow??) but most importantly, the unbelievably tensionless promotion of cryptocurrency as something that ‘just works’.

**Oh The Irony**

https://preview.redd.it/4d0x8qo6ka181.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfd8463e7d1436b36cc428a753949c8f7f8de616

That Putra was cheated before by these gold MLM schemes only to fall into another one that plays out like a MLM is an irony completely lost on the director of the film, Din C.J. Filled between the ‘plot’ are scenes of gorgeous Ipoh scenery, vacuous product placement, and no less than **6 instances** where the movie attempts to explain cryptocurrency as an ‘investment’. The biggest irony is the scene where everyone gathers in a conference room wearing T-Shirts of the coin, clapping and cheering for one another. [**Exactly** like you see in other MLM conferences](https://youtu.be/jIWX1_76sis?t=84), just less budget.

[The T-Shirts in question](https://preview.redd.it/sfw8bdkgma181.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b0fd71b01cb39e8b1f1bbf5c3febdd2ce409be)

Like I said, normally it would’ve been easy to write this movie off for what it is- an easy to make cash grab, looking to capitalize on the trend of crypto in Malaysia. It happens. Capitalizing on trendy buzzwords is something Hollywood does, with movies like [Crypto (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8563452/) or [The Emoji Movie (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4877122/). Just dumb but harmless movies right? But watching Budak Kripto, you ~~might be~~ will be shocked at the level of quality allowed today. That it is one of the first local movies to be shown after the recent lockdown is one thing, but that such blatant product placement was allowed is another. This isn’t so much a movie as it is an hour long advertisement. 

This brings up the question of Finas’ Mandatory Screening Scheme, a protectionist law that has been enforced since 2005 to protect local movies. The law as stated on Finas’ website states it’s intention- [the scheme was formed to accept and consider any local or joint venture films for compulsory screening at cinemas by exhibitors, running for a minimum of fourteen days in the biggest hall of the cinema](https://www.finas.gov.my/en/services/wajib-tayang/). Such laws are not unheard of, similar to the [one that buoyed Korea’s New Wave of Cinema](https://ecipe.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Parc-2018-Korean-film-industry-book-chapter.pdf) back in the late 60’s, and are often necessary to give local movies a chance to compete against the mega budget blockbusters of Hollywood.

[From a YT comment- Editor: Brapa artis veteran abg nk dlm trailer ni? Producer: Yes](https://preview.redd.it/8k29oedmla181.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7758902bae2e87157769463e28b5148e32cb1593)

For the most part it has been moderately successful, allowing fantastic films like [Terbaik Dari Langit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v26vrwlENU) or [Jagat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0UJgQdsLwo) a chance to shine on the same stage as the likes of Iron Man or Arrival. But for every player acting in good faith comes those that don’t, and Budak Kripto is most definitely a bad faith player. We need only look at the list of sponsors that comes with the credits, played out over a shameless use of a cover of Have You Ever Seen The Rain by Datuk Arumugam and the late Mamat Khalid (seriously, a knife to my heart knowing that such a great cameo will **forever belong** in this piece of garbage).

**Sponsorships in Movies**

[Do I shoot the bad guy, or do I buy PRINCE Lubricants? Decisions, decisions.](https://preview.redd.it/yu4i8o3hfa181.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=609e60666608f1d0eb56b04b65a11f842201c55d)

Usually some form of product placement is acceptable, even to be expected. Malaysian movie budgets are nothing compared to Hollywood, and it's only logical that some ad money makes it's way into movies. [Polis Evo’s shootout featuring Prince Lubricants](https://youtu.be/BV0UFvoixe4?t=444) comes to mind, but see, at the very least Polis Evo delivered an entertaining romp to go along with it. Budak Kripto completely abuses this unwritten trust between audience and cinema.

We have our usual list of suspects- venue, PDRM (joke pls no jail), food, skincare and make up sponsors. Forest Beauty/Color is one that sticks out, since there are dedicated scenes where the characters actually comment ""Oh wow, your skin is so clean! What's your secret?"". That's pretty on the nose. But most astonishingly, one of the sponsors is the **ACTUAL** [**NP Coin**](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Finance/npcforyou/posts/). This isn’t a fictitious made-up coin for the purposes of the story, but rather a **REAL** coin on the market, [trading for less than cents on the ringgit at the time of this writing](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/npcoin/myr). Coincidentally, this isn't reflected in the trailer itself.

[5 sen to put a flyer in a newspaper? That explains all those flyers I get...](https://preview.redd.it/fuxziwawma181.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb1161b9d977560797ffa0ccc9e60dbd01219e6)

The worst part of it all, is the lack of any kind of real education as to what cryptocurrencies even are or how they really can enable fortunes to be made. There's no details of them selling the damned coin, but rather strangely details of them promoting it pure MLM style. For example, there's a specific scene where he goes to an Indian run newspaper distribution hub and negotiates placing flyers in the newspapers. He's selling it through flyers, and one on one meetings. Huh?? Where's the actual process of it?? Like was crypto made to be sold physically like that??? (Answer is no, of course not)

**Conclusion**

https://preview.redd.it/e3xsq2vsha181.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea276eaa3011254487655d03eb91564ffffad6c

Cinema-goers may choose to vote with their wallet and not watch the film, but the core issue at hand here is how such a travesty was even allowed to be screened. In a country where [films like Babi have been banned](https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/film/namewees-banned-film-babi-receives-four-international-award-nominations-2820094) for even daring to have a trailer with controversial content, how is such insidious advertising not even addressed? Throughout the entire film, not a single bad word is thrown the way of NP Coin or cryptocurrency. Instead, this small unheard of coin is touted and flaunted as a viable way of making money, even allowing Putra to purchase an expensive Mustang at the end of the film (ridiculous). None of the issues of how so many of these [small coins become scams in their own right](https://coinsutra.com/cryptocurrency-scams/) are remotely brought up, nor the dangers and fluctuations of the market price of these digital currencies.

[Want one? Buy NP Coin today!](https://preview.redd.it/3agj4f6ija181.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b3e113866ac26580df95190fb19f576dfd335b5)

In a time when the government has [begun to regulate the trading](https://news.bitcoin.com/malaysia-regulating-cryptocurrencies/) of these digital currencies, Budak Kripto seems to be a baffling piece of ‘art’ allowed to be screened en masse. It’s almost as if the concept of coins such as the [infamous Squid Game Token](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/investing/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam/index.html) do not exist in this world crafted by the filmmakers, yet they are **prescient enough** to **include** relatable stories of **people** being **cheated** by **other money making schemes**. This just tells me that **the filmmakers are fully aware** of what they're doing and have fully taken advantage of the protectionist laws to promote this coin. To ban Babi, sure somewhat understandable that you don't want to 'inflame racial tensions'. Fine. But what about this?? What now LPF? Either this was negligence on the regulators to not properly screen this movie (unlikely given the stringent regulations), or there was a willful agreement to close one eye (makes more sense). 

Malaysian movies have deservedly received a lot of flak over the years for needless pandering or flaws in storytelling. But what Budak Kripto has done is take it a step further, establishing completely new ground for what is or is not acceptable in terms of promotion in movies. Consequently, money making cryptocurrency schemes are now acceptable. 

So no, this isn't a case of 'Why watch something good when you can watch something Malaysian too'. This is a very puzzling case of abuse of a government law, that will probably go unnoticed because no educated human being will willingly see this movie. There's no politics in this. This is just a straight up ad, allowed to screen for 97 minutes. What a waste of RM17.","Just reading the movie's plot is enough for any educated joe to detect this movie is just a bait for people to engage into crypto and MLM investments with no substance or whatever meaningful plot. || i dont think anything shown in the poster made to the movie. at this point im leaning towards 4d marketing || I think you mean 'ponzi scheme'.

"‘Super’ real estate agent insults Grab drivers, food riders",,"Lol i didn’t know that u are classified as a ‘super agent’ once u can buy a vellfire, get a personal driver and own a luxury watch? Such a punchable face la dei || Implying that people actually thought being a Grab driver can make you rich. These people barely making ends meet and you shitting on them. Real class || What a dumb thing to say || Trashy toxic people. You don’t want these people to be working with you or even be friends. || [deleted] || In a video posted on social media two days ago, both individuals were seen to be conducting a drive to recruit real estate agents.

However, it went awry when the Mandarin-speaking duo started to insult Grab drivers and food riders, saying that they will never end up rich, triggering negative responses from netizens.

In the video, after stating that they “do not mean to talk bad about Grab riders”, the duo proceeded to say that Grab drivers and Grab food riders will never get rich, before proceeding to laugh at those who chose the career path.

Is there other Food Delivery better than Grab?,"Is there any other food delivery that is better than Grab? The reason why I am using Grab is because it is tied to Grab car which I mostly use, and since they share the wallet, it's convenient.

However, recently I am noticing something odd with how their app shows which shop is ""available"" or which is ""out of delivery area"", which I find concerning. Whether you're a customer ordering food, or a shop selling food, or even the grab delivery rider, I think it's something to look at. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking at other food delivery apps.

A bit of back story, I wanted to order food from a favorite shop, which is relatively near to my place. Unfortunately, I couldn't order as the shop is ""whited out"" stating it is ""out of delivery area"". However, I noticed some shops that are of similar distance are available. I asked their Twitter support as to what's the reasoning for this one, and they said that it's either lack of delivery riders in the area or ""due to weather"". It wasn't lunch time so it wasn't peak hours, nor was it raining at that time. They said that this is how the app automatically handles such situations. And because of this logic, the app suggests shops that are > 10km away, however it chargers delivery for the same amount as that of when the shop is just near.

This to me seems like a red flag if I am a food seller or a delivery rider on their platform. If I'm a seller, I would be mad if I found that the app is blocking me from getting orders on the pretext that the app assumes there's no delivery riders nearby. If I'm a delivery rider, I would end up having to deliver to people that are so far away, only to be paid a measly amount as delivery.

It doesn't make sense to me as to why they have the need to disable the shop. Why don't they just put a premium on the delivery charge like how they add premium to grab car whenever it's peak hours? It's their delivery riders' prerogative if they want to take the delivery or not. The shop gets their orders, the delivery riders gets paid extra, and the customer gets the food that they want, everyone is happy.","It could be that the particular restaurant disabled the GrabFood app from their side due to reasons e.g. not enough staff to handle both dine in customer orders and food delivery orders. || [deleted] || Try shoopee food, some riders/shops move over there( enjoying the honeymoon period), that might be the reason :-s || Try Beepit || Try AirAsia, Gojek and Food panda || I've seen AirAsiaFood. do they offer BIG points when you purchase from their platform? I'm going to assume they integrated their food delivery with their Airlines mileage program, at least. || and those vouchers cut off big boi prices, just need more restaurants on there. || thanks! I'll check it out. do they use their Shopeepay as payment option or do you have to pay via online banking? || yeah I'm using beepit to order from a specific shop that is only available in their app. I think the advantage is I can pay using grab pay too. || I've tried food panda once.

Transition to cycling as daily commute: Doable or not in Malaysia?,"Hi guys,

Like a lot of you here, my primary means of tranaportation for the past 2 decades has been driving. I used to drive to work, to eat, and to the gym.

But during MCO, I hardly used my car, and when regulations for walking as exercise opened up, I started walking with my wife. First it was around the condo compound, then we started walking up stairs. 

Gradually we became more adventurous, and now find ourselves routinely walking to the shops nearby to tapao food or to grab an afternoon coffee.

There were some instances when I got a bit too adventurous and tried carrying 8kg of kitty litter home from the shops. Not my fines moment of decision making, but we made the 3km round trip in 1 piece.

This kinda opened up my thoughts to getting us a pair of bicycles. Sure, primarily would just be used to bike out to get coffee nearby and tapao food - or maybe load them up into the car for a weekend ride in one of Putrajaya's many lush parks.

But after watching how Westerners use their folding bikes along with pubkic transportation, I wondered if I could do more with a bike. If I could use it as a primary mode ot transportation for daily tasks.

My office is about 4km away, which should be an easy bike ride, and if it rains or if I'm working late, I could always fold up and Grab home with the bike in the boot.

The MRT station is a 10 min walk door to door from my home, and since its not as widely used as LRT, I reckon that I could get away with folding it up and taking it along with me on the train if I really needed to.

I still have my car, and don't plan to sell it or trade up any time soon, so naturally that will also be part of my travel options (eg. Going for work meetings, balik kampung, taking wife out for dinner, buying groceries).

My question is - am I crazy to want to do this? Am I imagining a lifestyle that isn't suited for our local climate / traffic? Does anyone else here have a similar daily commute?","4km is easy for cycling, just make sure you are safe and aware of your surrounding, wear protective gears like helmet and get some UV protection/ raincoat. 

if you needed car for something, its just 20minutes back to your car isn't it? that's more or less time required for you to get to your car in a shopping mall.

I would cycling if the work place is within 15km to my home. || Definitely doable. Needs good preparation. First needs a good bike. Don't get one that is too cheap and heavy. Needs something that folds down to a small managable weight and size. Helmet, panniers, lights and good locks are essential. Plan your trip and  route you will take. Try out on a less busy day, one or 2 days a week initially. You need somewhere safe to store your bike at work. You need a change of clothes and a a place to change or shower at work and a place to stash your gear.  I've done it under less than optimal conditions and it can be done. || My dad used to cycle from our place in Puchong all to way to his office in KL once a week (for years!) bcs he couldnt find any other time to work out. I still think its crazy but yeah definitely doable. All the best to you! || I have always advocated for walking with a purpose. Helps even when you do your regular shopping. It's surprising how frugal you become once you realise you have to hand carry the stuff home!

Cycling here is a life or death situation because 2 generations of drivers have forgotten about sharing road space and the town councils gave up planning to private property developers who don't see short distance connectivity and convenience to the larger public as essential.

Even in small towns you run the risk of being knocked down by motorcyclists.

This coming from me who as a youth cycled all over my small Bandar of Pontian Kecil in Johor, 4 decades ago. Fun times with the Raleigh Chopper and Hercules. Sigh. || Why would you be crazy to do this?

Folding bikes are allowed on all of our trains and buses. Even LRT. No issues there. Folding bikes don't take up very much space so crowds aren't an issue. || 4km is doable for cycling. My old workplace was 5km from my residence, and I walked to and from every workday (aiming for 10k steps) If I can walk without a hitch, cycling will be a breeze.

Just keep an extra pair of work clothes at the office in case of emergency, like mud on cloth from a passing car driving through a puddle, heavy rain mid-cycle, or bird poop. || I think it's mostly depends on your route to work. Some place really is too car centric that even for a short distance of 4km, it would not be safe to ride bicycle everyday.

I would suggest you try walking the whole route first. If you feel comfortable walking, then cycling should be fine. || It's a little rare for people to do that in Malaysia, but it's safe to say you are far from the first person to do something like this. || As someone who studied overseas and relied on my legs as transportation, the only issue i have doing the same thing in Malaysia is the heat and humidity. 

Besides having a place to shower at your destination/work, biggest thing to consider is UV protection. || Wah goodluck OP, I hope it works out well for you.

You can plan out the route and try it out first on weekends, see if it's feasible or not. Really curious how this will turn out to be.",13/9/2021,27,45,1631514084,malaysia,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/pn9w3c/transition_to_cycling_as_daily_commute_doable_or/
Does anyone still able to use GrabPay on modified devices?,"This is my previous post a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab\_wallet\_suspending\_soon\_for\_modified\_devices/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kcbbeq/grab_wallet_suspending_soon_for_modified_devices/)

I just wanted to ask: does anyone with Magisk still able to use or it's a no since 6/1/2021?

During that time, I still able to use even after 6/1/2021. But now, I can't anymore. Wallet is there with balance but grab just acted like it knows I'm using Magisk or has root, and prohibits me from using GrabPay. Grab even asked me for root access, which clearly indicates that the app is able to detect root. TouchNGo and all other apps are working, thus there's no problem with the Magisk Hide. 

It's been a while since I last used Grab so I'm not sure about this, hope someone could shed some light on this. If I'm not mistaken, few months back it is still working because I attempted to place GrabFood order and seems to work just well. 

Sigh, very inconvenient.","i have another android rooted with magisk with grab installed. i can still open the app and everything works as usual. did you install xposed? || [deleted] || Never. Never used xposed since I moved to using Magisk, haha..

I do have an app called ""Taichi"" and I wonder it causes the detection. I will try to remove that and see. Other than that, I have no more idea, since TNG, ShopeePay, Boost all working fine. And I didn't mess with my phone for quite a long time already also. || Much appreciated for the reply! Esp. on the root prompt, almost forget that it won't know unless granted, dumb me :facepalm: I used to think that it won't prompt for root access when it does not detect root .\_.

Then.. it's quite unclear already what's going on on my end. I haven't changed anything in my phone in the past few months, everything is literally the same. Magisk with MagiskHide and also custom package name, all untouched. Thanks for the info on VPN, yeah I'm not using a VPN. 

Looks like Grab is still working alongside Magisk then. Thanks! That's quite a relief.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/

My thought is not that it will not generate profit to cover any cost, but to generate enough profit to cover the cost.

Coming Home - Travelling for a Funeral during COVID - The DCEV Scheme,"This is partly a story, partly a guide for DCEV travel between Singapore and Malaysia. Not sure where to start but I guess from when my spouse and I received word of the passing of her parent on Wednesday morning just this week. I write this in the hopes that whoever that needs to return will find this guide/story and learn from the issues we faced and the troubles we had trying to get 2 immediate family members home in time for the funeral of their late parent.

As we got the news, we started looking for information on how the DCEV process was conducted between MY/SG to facilitate the return of immediate relatives. This process isn't very new nor very old, it was first announced in May 2021.

Source: [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-and-malaysia-start-accepting-applications-for-cross-border-travel-on-compassionate](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-and-malaysia-start-accepting-applications-for-cross-border-travel-on-compassionate)

To facilitate the process, information is available on both the SG SafeTravel website and the MY Jabatan Immigresen website

* Source MY: [https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?termConditionDCEV](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?termConditionDCEV)
* Source SG: [https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/dcev/overview](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/dcev/overview)

* Application form and checklist: [https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/doc/Appendix-4-KKM.pdf](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/doc/Appendix-4-KKM.pdf)

The application form lists all required documents that you need to send to CPRC so I won't list in detail but the basics are as below:

* Death certificate <- Due to the # of cases, it took an entire day to confirm if my in-law died of COVID or otherwise, thankfully the test result was negative
* Proof of familial relations - E.g. a birth certificate
* Address of the funeral parlour/home/location where body is kept
* The intended time of your visit/attendance

The application and above documents are then sent to CPRC, you can review the application procedures in the link given above, and we received our reply within the hour with a 3-day approval for my wife and her sibling to return to KL. We called CPRC Selangor with the phone number provided in the email approval and clarified more information. At that moment it seemed like all was good as the person answering our questions seemed to have all the answers, this will become important later!

**(Note: Moving forward, I will cover only KLIA inbound flights as that was what they opted for)**

After approval was provided, there was a mad rush to procure the necessary PPE and a RT-PCR PDT(pre-departure test) from an accredited lab in SG. My wife is a COVID frontliner in SG and her colleagues did all that they could to help her, we owe them a lot. Her department also did what they could to facilitate and escalate any internal processes required so she could get approval to travel as healthcare staff are not allowed any form of overseas travel in the last 2.5 years or so barring exceptional circumstances.

The PDT is important as it has to be done within 72 hours of the flight to/from KL/SG. So if you can afford it (and I say this for good reason), you pay for the expedited results, or you plan to return at a date/time within the 72-hour window of the test being taken. This is VERY important if you’re Muslim as Muslim burials are conducted within the first 24 hours of death, taking a PCR test requires a minimum of 4-6 hours assuming where you are travelling from isn't facing a huge COVID caseload that will backlog all PCR-testing labs. You need to adjust your flight dates and planned visit time to the funeral venue appropriately.

**(Note: MY's list is an image and therefore very unhelpful for searching)**

With the approval in hand, appropriate certs, and PCR PDT done, you should now have all the documents printed in hand ready for travel back to MY! That's what we thought too. We were assured by CPRC Selangor that they and NADMA would facilitate all arrangements under the DCEV scheme. But in the end, my wife and her sibling had to make most of the arrangements on their own due to poor coordination.

Departure the following day was smooth, no issues at the Singapore-end since you're outbound. Can't say much about the flight, not like there was complimentary WiFi she could use (sorry, I digress).

Now comes the part where everything falls apart and the nightmare starts so take heed of the details.

Upon landing in KLIA, you are greeted with a bunch of forms and PCR/RTK-Ag tests to perform. Now, as you no doubt will have noticed, the flow-chart I linked earlier only requires a RTK-Ag test to be performed and paid for, not a RT-PCR. Also, as my in-law is now a Singapore citizen, they are treated as a foreign entrant and therefore required to pay an ""operational cost"" fee. At no time was it communicated that my wife and her sibling had to make themselves known as being inbound passengers under the DCEV scheme. Nor were they ever asked. There is a severe communications breakdown for both processing staff and inbound passengers. They ended up taking an extra swab-test (PCR) which they weren't required to as a result! The ""operational cost"" fee is also not commonly provided in any of the KKM or Immigration documentation all of us reviewed online so when you're at your most vulnerable at the port of entry, you are now told you have to pay the additional fee, of no small value in order to proceed. You also fill in all your MySJ details at this point.

&#x200B;

To recap:

**Fill up form for RTK > Wait for results (approx 1 to 2 hours but they had it within 45 minutes or so) > Results are out > Approval form verified and approved by the Dr > Proceed to arrange quarantine facility > Proceed to counter to pay > Immigration clearance > Transport to quarantine station**

&#x200B;

You have to wait an hour (or more) for the RTK-Ag test to be processed, telling you whether you're clear to proceed or you get quarantined and moved to a hospital, having tested positive. But because there are not a lot of DCEV scheme entries, the quarantine/processing staff are unfamiliar with how to onboard returnees like my wife and her sibling so it takes additional time. As there were prior batches of passengers before my wife and her sibling rocked up, it took an additional hour of waiting as her sibling had to have her passport processed in the international passport gate along with all the other foreigners that showed up from other flights. Don't expect much by way of social distancing, to keep this post neutral, I shall not mention any nationalities.

**(Note: All payments are made once RTK-Ag tests are done**)

At this point, you're tired, hungry, needing to pee... but you have to continue on. After processing, collecting your baggage, you head out to the transport that will take you to your quarantine station. But hold up, there's a snag. Before boarding the bus, your luggage needs to be sprayed. As the group that was put together with my wife and her sibling shared the same bus to the same hotel, they didn't speak a lick of English and neither did quarantine staff speak whatever the passengers spoke. So lots of confusion everywhere as they had to perform specific tasks and leave luggage in a specific area for sanitization. A lack of instructions, signage and communication compounded the delay in the transfer from the airport to the bus to the hotel. My wife complained the bus smelt of cigarette smoke but I like to think that it was deliberate to see if anyone were missing their olfactory senses (haha)!

As a result, by then, my wife and her sibling had completely missed their initial request date and time for attending the evening prayer service at the funeral parlour and did not get to see their parent that day. It was also late and the funeral parlour had also closed by then. Next stop was the hotel and upon arrival, a bunch more forms to fill, only for my wife and her sibling to realize some forms did not apply to them so they stopped filling them in. Important as the grace period given for them to remain in Malaysia by CPRC Selangor is only 3 days and they have to be sent back or travel back (somehow) to SG at the end of the grace period.

Additional costs are required to be paid here as although CPRC S'gor informed us that all would be taken care of arrangement-wise, none of the travel was expedited and they missed their parent's funeral service for that evening, WHICH THEY APPLIED FOR in the DCEV application. There's also additional costs to pay, like the hotel accommodation, hotel food, ambulance transport to the funeral venue, doctor's swab-test for PDT, to name a few. I'll cover the total amount at the end of the post.

The grace period is now important as you only have those 3-days (or however many days CPRC decides to grant) to attend the funeral, get back to the quarantine hotel and arrange for PDT in time to get to your flight back to SG. You are also not allowed close contact during any funeral proceedings.

Now, my wife and her sibling made it to the final service and cremation this morning but there's a third flaw to this wheel that is the DCEV process. As SG also requires that you take a PDT before entering and airlines won't let you get onboard without one too. In the current COVID situation, it takes 3-days (as of July 15th) for a PCR test to be processed so doing it via a gov facility would take too long. But as you are a PUS (Person-Under-Surveillance) you CANNOT leave the quarantine hotel at all, so how do you do a PCR PDT? You have two choices, government or private. But in order to do private, you have to find a doctor from the approved list (shared above) or who has access to an approved lab by KKM to perform the PCR PDT test. My wife and her sibling were fortunate enough to have the help of the hotel with this as they managed to find a doctor late into the evening to help perform the PDT the following day after the cremation.

The airlines are fairly flexible in allowing you to reschedule flights at no extra costs so you can make the flight back once the PDT results are out. We're now waiting for the final part to happen, that is, the flight back to SG and another 14-days of quarantine before I can once again see my spouse. I don't expect to update this main post much after the outbound flight but I definitely will again tomorrow evening once I get more information on the outbound trip.

**(Note: My wife and her sibling picked Singapore Airlines as SQ allows for unlimited booking changes)**

***UPDATE:***

*With the PCR PDT done for the Singapore leg of the journey, both she and her sibling have been escorted via ambulance back to KLIA for the departure to SG. However, upon arrival at the airport, the escort, in full PPE, I should add, has left along with the ambulance and they are left to their own devices. Glaring procedural errors are abound here, what if they decide NOT to return? What if something happens to them? How will NADMA track their whereabouts? It's easy to disappear into the city, provided you can scrounge transport. Shouldn't they be handed off to KLIA staff? For the DCEV scheme, would it not be wise to have someone keeping an eye on them end-to-end? Hopefully there's more information later.*

I'm also happy to try and answer questions that anyone has. All-in-all, while I would NEVER recommend anyone travel using the DCEV route for an immediate family member's demise or future demise based on my wife's and her sibling's experience, there are not many options available. DCEV travel has to weigh the costs and risks involved and with the amount of ongoing COVID cases, the lack of established protocols and piss-poor coordination executed for the MY side of the DCEV scheme, it's difficult to support the use such a scheme without some major improvements and refinement.

**TOTAL: RM4930 excl SG section of any fees**

EDIT#1: This has been reposted with some grammatical corrections, timeline corrections and a review by boss-wife.

EDIT#2: Wife's sibling ordered KFC to the wrong room, under the wrong name. No Kepsi tonight for either of them. So if you quarantine, use the same name for both the order and the room. And get the room number right too. Also, different hotels have different rules as I have discovered earlier tonight, Grab is only allowed once at the hotel they're in but a friend's father wasn't restricted at all at their quarantine station.

"Over a year ago, I opened my own FnB business selling fried chicken and asked r/Malaysia things you as customers would like street hawkers do to justify buying regularly from them. This month would be my last month as a business. Here's my story.","Link to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im\_about\_to\_open\_my\_own\_gerai\_selling\_ayam\_goreng/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/10k5gv8/im_about_to_open_my_own_gerai_selling_ayam_goreng/)   
  
Warning: This is gonna be a long ass post. Head over to TLDR below for summary.

**1. Background**

In Feb 2023, I opened my own small business selling fried chicken under a renowned brand from Johor. Let's call it the MHC brand (dead giveaway, I know). After paying a certain amount of RM to its HQ, I got the right to sell the MHC product in my hometown. I was ecstatic. 

Having researched the brand awareness and the market demand for 3 months, I was convinced the business is financially viable if I can manage 4 P's well: product, price, place and promo. It also helps that I have 3 years experience in FnB business prior to this venture.

**2. Game Plan**

The ultimate plan is to hand over the business to my brother once I finished training him how to run it. I also planned to expand to 2 more locations in 3 years (and therefore 3 locations by 2026). 

Why the handover? I have another sdn bhd I still have to manage. Therefore I took no salary.   
Why 3 locations by 2026? To lower cost of purchasing raw materials and maximise profit margin (and finally give me some salary).

To paint you a picture: if one location hits minimum monthly sales, it generates approximately RM2,500-RM3,000 net profit. 3 locations = RM7,500-9,000 net profit.

**3. The Execution**

Based on the 4P's of marketing, these are what we've encountered.

Product  
1. HQ products' are limited to proteins only. No carbs and drinks.  
2. HQ's Korean sauce game is exhaustingly weak. The viscosity isn't right. The taste isn't right. And we, the agents, can't tamper with it.  
3. The most prevalent complain from customers is the blackened chicken bones. HQ dismiss the complain completely.  
  
Price  
1. HQ position their product as mid-tier options for fried chicken. But most agents sell by the roadside, making us vulnerable to comparison with cheaper options.

Place  
1. Sales increases whenever we join events, festivals outside our usual locations.   
2. Listing our products in FoodPanda and GrabFood is a must. Without fail, these platforms represent 30% of our total sales (which I think is decent since we're operating outside major city).

Promo  
1. HQ's promo effort is disappointingly minimal. No ads spend whatsoever in both digital and traditional space. Too reliant on TikTok's generous organic reach (which is unsustainable).

And these are what we've done:

Product  
1. Add rice, fries and drinks options.   
2. Give a 10% discount voucher every time customers complain about HQ's weak Korean sauce.  
3. See above.

Price  
1. We can't tamper with the price. So we present ourselves as mid-tier options accordingly. No more roadside stall. We store freshly fried chickens in a proper food warmer. Cleanliness is decent (despite our best effort. See below)

Place  
1. Move into a permanent location provided by the Majlis Daerah. It's spacious, the rent is relatively cheap and we're no longer have to cram our staff into our van. UNFORTUNATELY we have to deal with the 'cat ladies' makciks who feed every stray cats passing through our premise. As a result, our premise looks and feels ghetto as fuck.  
2. We join events and festivals if and only if we can manage the logistics.   
3. We always join FoodPanda and GrabFood promo deals if there is one. The only thing we don't participate is the one where vendors have to pay if they want to rank higher in listings.

Promo  
1. RM500/month allocated for Meta advertising without fail. 

**4. The Result**

1. The addition of rice, fries and drinks options did increase our sales. But it's not significant (around 10%).   
2. Most of our customers didn't even use the 10% off voucher we gave.  
3. Sales peak during school season, decreases during school holiday period. However, Q4 2023 was our best quarter due to a lot of catering requests from school teachers/parents (for jamuan celebrating the end of school year).  
4. During the height of KFC and McD boycott, the sales did reflect significantly ;)  
5. From Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, we recorded losses during these two months: April (Ramadan) and May (Raya month) 2023.   
6. Median net profit from Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: RM3,500. Average loss: -RM1,500.  
7. Sales could've been better had other vendors avoid opening/closing their business erratically. When all vendors open, our premise is bustling with customers. When they close, sales got affected 

**5. The Last Straw**

Silly me. I was adhering to the 4P's of marketing instead of the 5P's of marketing. I completely underestimate the fifth P: People. 

Staffing has been my major headache since Day 1. I've had staff who went MIA mid-shift, stole from the cash register, showed up late macam kedai bapak dia, close shop early macam kedai nenek dia and other headaches I'm sure every employers has been through.

But that's not the worst. The worst is when I mix family with business. I should've not let my brother near my business. If your family members understand and know how to keep things professional, you can mix family with business. If they don't, don't mix family with business. Otherwise, they'll treat everything you said personal. Like you're out to get them. 

Before this business, I've never had to quarrel with my brother. My mom never had to deal with us arguing to the point she had to beg us to stop while crying. Now we aren't in speaking terms. When I drop some stuff at our shop, we act like we're invisible to each other. 

When my mom asked me to not punish my brother's lack of professionalism at workplace, coincidentally coupled with my one dependable staff tendering her resignation last week, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Family favouritism ain't my thing. Clearly my family can't separate business with family affairs. 

So I've decided to close the business fearing it would make things worse for my family. My brother can always find another job. How about the plan to hand over the business to him? I realized it was a pipe dream. What about opening up 3 more locations? Well, life stood in the way.

**6. What I Learned**

1. FnB can't be managed half-heartedly. You gotta go all in. If I don't have other money-making avenues, I would've probably cut ties with my brother, roll up my sleeve and keep persevering. But I have, so I don't.  
  
2. If you're interested to open MHC business, remember these golden rules:  
- Only hire 1 staff for every 200 pcs fried chicken sold daily. If you're selling more than that, you can consider hiring another staff to make things less chaotic.  
- Run Meta ads about your availability for catering and target them to school teachers and parents 1-2 months before school year ends.  
- Always reject staff candidates with these criteria: Under 30 and unmarried, mentions 'part time' before you even bring it up, family members applying on his/her behalf.  
- Primary customer avatar: Working Malay mothers in their 30s

3. Though it's short-lived, I've no regret. Barring the family drama, it was a decent business venture. I gained nothing financially from this business, but I managed to give two staff competitive salaries (well above minimum salary regulation) without having to migrate to KL for more than a year.

**TLDR**

1. Opened fried chicken business with a family member  
2. Underestimate the importance of staffing  
3. Had to close business before family situation gets worse  
4. Learned some lesson.

Item ordered through Food panda isn't labelled as non-halal ,"Last week me and my friend went to the new Sunway Donquixote store and he bought an Ajinomoto Gyoza. After giving it a glowing review when he got home I thought why not get one. Ajinomoto website mentions that you can get one from Aeon and there was one near me.

I ordered one through Food panda since I can get it cheaper with vouchers but when it came it has different packaging from my friend's and it came from Thailand with no halal logo. Even the soy sauce ingredients mentioned it has alcohol. After a bit of digging the new Halal Ajinomoto Gyoza (that my friend got) launched in November while mine are manufactured in September.

Went to the Aeon and checked, it's not in the non-halal section but they said that to take the refund issue through Food panda. Asked through the Food panda customer help chat and it said to use the 'Halal' tag on the search function which doesn't exist (AI?) and said that a refund is ineligible since I received the ordered item. Asking in here for thoughts and help.","Apa susah kawan?

Thoughts on shopee food,"I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment? Shopee food app is stupid hard to navigate though, maybe I just need that learning curve, so wanna get a sense of if its worth it before I commit to anything.

I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad for shopee food, it isn't, I've brought them to tribunal court for their shit delivery twice.","Always have used only Shopeefood. Cheaper and can use coins. The other two expensive lah || Shopee Food used to allow combination of 2 vouchers (1 for food discount, 1 for free/discount on delivery) which made is mad cheap! Now only 1 voucher is applicable || it's straight up shit.I understand if it is rainy or traffic holiday and no drivers can be found or not drivers wants to take the order.

i have my mcdonald here cost 1 ringgit for delivery but shopee is 3 ringgit (example lah aiiyoo)  
but shopee is dominant for its discount/voucher,cant deny that  
for tracking order,grab no.1 for me,when rider move its follows along while shopee will skip skip their route (although i could just close-and-open the app to track *accurately*) || It will be cheaper until it become big, then they will jack up the price the like the two services. At that time, hopefully there will be another upcoming service which will be cheaper to attract customers || Is this true for most cases?

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive.

Just my assumptions. Put into Excel spreadsheet and adjust according to own circumstances:

Hostel room with single person: RM600 (RM300-400 if sharing, RM1000 for more luxurious options)

Total = RM190, round to RM200 for safety



TOTAL:
Low: RM1350
Mid: RM1750
High: RM2250


I might have missed something. Just put into Excel sheet and edit as something comes to mind. Have some savings, and adjust excel sheet as expenses pop up. Reduce expenses if income not enough to support.

I assume you're asking for your kid, if so remember to consider if your kid travels back to hometown to meet you. If yes, need to consider in budget and maybe increase a bit for kid to have more leeway in spending. Ask him to report his spending and adjust spreadsheet if you're worried your kid bazir. Use the spreadsheet to find any suspicious spending. Budget using highest expected spending. Always budget enough, don't budget expecting to skip a meal or something. || I got 750 allowance monthly , but I save by doing laundry at my parents house , going back at weekends the occasional gas refill by them so I extrapolate roughly to 1.2k. Should say my location is Bangi. || For me, food alone is RM30 a day with a bit of leeway to go a bit higher or lower(Not more or less than RM5). This is only possible because I eat 2 times a day and I make sure I eat heavy enough to not lose or gain weight.

Basically, what I do is buy food from the closest Uni eateries and pay 8-12 for my first meal and 20-25 for grab food for my second meal.   Have to be smart to pick food from Grab to get the bang for my buck portion wise.

So, that's roughly RM900 a month.

IF other things like leisure stuff and necessary self maintenance stuff included, maybe 1200-1300 all together. || Hah like that , 900 enough ? Can cook your own food ?

This is atrocious especially doing it during festival season. I hope pro bono lawyers will came forward to sue the company. || I understand the need to save money. But the truth is, our discounts have to be subsidised by someone else. It could be FoodPanda’s shareholders, FoodPanda, the vendors, and/or the riders.

I highly doubt investors still want to continue to plough money into FoodPanda since it’s already a maturing company. When there is no more cash infusion, FoodPanda has to be judicious with its working capital. It cannot simply throw out prices like it used to three or four years ago. Vendors have [expressed their discontent with FoodPanda over hidden charges and the lack of transparency in payments](https://themalaysianreserve.com/2021/11/09/vendors-on-foodpanda-protest-hidden-costs/). [Commissions paid to FoodPanda are also already high](https://www.thesundaily.my/home/30-fee-for-delivery-service-too-high-say-eatery-operators-LG8181591), making their margins razor-thin. If the food prices are too cheap, then it may not be economical for the vendors to sell food and drinks on FoodPanda. But many are desperate for sales because there are just too many competition.

I feel that if we were to use a food delivery service, it would be only fair to pay a bit extra. Logically speaking, there is a middleman that needs to make money. There is also cost to deliver the food. We are getting the convenience of having the food delivered to our doorstep, so there should be a premium for the convenience.

This is why I have always questioned the viability of all these e-commerce platforms. They throw discounts like crazy and make consumers expect cheap prices will continue forever. But money will be burned in the process, the riders’ pays continue to be suppressed, and more often than not we get subpar services. It’s a no-win scenario for everyone in the long term. || Shitty company with shitty policies that trouble both the customer and rider. It's about time the youth should realize that the reality of being a full time gig workers. 

Not only it doesn't guarantee stable income, it also curbing your progress in which you better spend the time learning a handy skill that have better prospect in generating income.

The current delivery market are too oversaturated and it is not longer as profitable as it used to be during MCO time. In the end, gig jobs are just to supplement your income not as the main job.

FoodPanda Malaysia has gotten to a new low. Where got free delivery?,,"With panda pro you get free delivery with any order RM25 and above. If you dont have panda pro, KFC probably gives free delivery on its own. Usually the restaurant would have a pink message up top stating how much you need to pay before you can get a free delivery (its usually 25 or 30 ringgit). Make sure to update your app to ensure the message appears

Btw do note the free delivery ONLY applies to delivery fees, restaurant can still charge extra fees. || It's a bait tag, they state free delivery on alot of shops but u need Panda Pro to actually use it. And the shit thing is, even with Panda Pro there is still minimum spend in order to get free delivery. || I think the bigger news for me is that KFC has become as expensive as Nando's quarter chicken set used to be, 6 years back.

And KFC has become utter shit, last I checked back in late 2018. || Delivery fees aside, the note about ""same as in store price"" is scummy. Most of the time the base price are jacked up along with hidden charges such as packaging. 
It shocked me today when ordering spade burger set cost rm38 bucks?!!
 Compared to spades own website, the price at grab is more than 10 bucks more expensive.

I'm thinking about moving out of KL for less dense areas. Which small city is the best?,"I (30 M) have had enough of the 'urban lifestyle'. I can't take the constant road construction, traffic jams, loud-ass Grab/FoodPanda bikes and constant badgering from my colleagues insisting on 3-hour physical meetings when things can be sorted out with emails. 

FYI I work as a Web3 writer. I've been mulling about this for 2 years now. Currently I'm juggling a full time job and a remote writing job. The remote job pays higher than the FT job. And the workload is lower. So I'm thinking about resigning from the FT job, getting another remote writing gig and moving out of KL for small cities with good Internet coverage (preferably Unifi). 

My wife and I have no strong attachment to any cities or states (though I kinda like Taiping). As long as the area have Unifi coverage, we're pretty much set on our way. So which less dense cities/daerah/mukim (besides Taiping) would you recommend us?","Depends on what kind of conveniences that you cannot do without. Unifi availability at larger towns, like Taiping, is a given but be aware that depends on which housing area you're staying at since speed at some of the housing areas could be throttled due to the number of switches for that area could be limited and thus, lower average speeds. That does not mean you don't get the speed you signed up for as you will still get the spikes of speed to what you signed up for but the sustained rates are low.

Somewhat similar to Taiping is Muar, Johor. Do note that Muar is more prone to flooding than Taiping since it is located at the river mouth of Sungai Muar that empties into the Straits of Malacca. Will need to take that into account with the worsening climate situation. There are 2 other towns in Johor worth considering as well - Batu Pahat and Kluang. Batu Pahat is a larger version of Muar. It is set slightly further back from the coast but is built-up around the Sungai Batu Pahat. Kluang is further inland like Taiping.

If you don't mind a larger place, my hometown of Ipoh may be considered although prices are slowly creeping up towards KL prices. If you don't plan to regularly travel to the city centre, you can avoid a lot of the congestion as the suburbs and outskirts are relatively self-sustaining and even have their respective shopping malls. For example, there are 3 Aeon Malls in Ipoh and located in the Ipoh Garden suburb, Menglembu suburb, and Klebang outskirts of Ipoh.

For an out-of-the-box location, you may want to consider Pulau Langkawi. Duty-free island. Idyllic. Prices of dailies would be closer to KL due to transportation costs but otherwise, foreign imported goods are duty-free. || Seremban lei...got nothing,so peaceful..got unifi also. || kota kinabalu or kuching. I would try either this too. No experience staying there but i know a tech company has a team in KK. Visited my friend in Kuching, my impression educated abroad young adults who choose to remain there, i guess the city will offer some different experience there. Sorry lacking the right vocab to describe properly, hope you get what i mean 😅 || Tanjung Malim. Not that far from KL. Not that far from Ipoh. Very very quiet. Population of trainee teachers, palm oil farmers, and pensioners. Got Unifi and Yik Mun Pau || Kuantan lol || Putrajaya || Try Janda Baik/Bukit Tinggi in Pahang. It’s more of a settlement than a town. Buy land there and build a house. Unifi is available but only at selected areas.

It’s a really beautiful place nestled within rolling hills shrouded in morning mists. Lots of good food and morning markets selling fresh produce. The weather is cool and the air is crisp. 

For amenities it’s just a 30 minute drive to KL but it’s isolated enough to feel separated from the larger Klang Valley conurbation. || Kuching 100% || If I choose to escape this urban hell that is KL, I'd probably move to Langkawi or Pangkor. I love island/beach life. || I love Taiping too. One of the towns I've shortlisted for my retirement.

https://maps.app.goo.gl/4vUzDVbN6U6fRpKA9 || What are your opinions about Malaysian food compared to our neighboring countries like Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia? Being someone who travelled extensively around this region, I think you would have the chance to sample each country's unique cuisine.

No one ask for it, but here's my take anyways. The variety of food in Malaysia is probably the widest in SEA, mostly due to the fact we are a multicultural society rather than an assimilated one like Indonesia, Thailand or Vietnam. Their food is excellent, but it's more focused and narrow. 

The closest comparison to Malaysia is obviously Singapore. However, Singapore's local cuisines are only comparable to what we have in Malaysian urban areas (Standard stuff like Nasi Lemak, Char Kuey Teow etc.). What they do not get to experience is the crazy variety of food options from the East Coast and Borneo. || Food =

1. Nasi Lemak
2. Durian (Durian season is coming next month or two.)

A Rant About The Panda of Food.,"I don't know if FoodPanda/Panda Mart is generally this bad for everyone; I don't order much, but I've had consistent problems with them. Has anyone had a very awful experience with Panda?

Almost a week ago, I ordered two simple things via Panda Mart to use a coupon or a voucher of some sort that was expiring that very day. Simple enough, just a bottle of shampoo and some cereal. It shouldn't be hard at all - there's no right for this to be. About 45 minutes later, the products arrive and a family member goes to pick them up. There's no receipt, and the two products ordered were wrong. They were of the same brand and desired item, but were literally half the size and volume. Essentially, I was scammed out of half of what I paid for. When my family member inquired as to why this was, the rider made no explanation about the receipt, just told them to ""call Panda"", and rode off.

That very day, I made a complaint/support ticket via their Help Center online requesting an explanation and a refund - or at least a refund for the value of the half I didn't receive. However, I was met with the most ridiculous string of events.

The ticket was made just fine; I got an email from someone in Panda requesting a picture and details. I, of course, acquiese and send a picture with the requested details via email. What came in response just a few seconds later? An automated email from support+noreply@foodpanda.my to tell me: *""Please be informed this email address is no longer in use. We've since eased the process for our customers to reach us. You may now submit any request via Help Center and we'll do our best to help you within 24 hours. Apart from ensuring an easier process for you, it'll also allow us to address your issue faster.""*

Well, if I couldn't send the details via email, I will do so via the Help Center. Isn't that what's it for? So I post it again on the Help Center's ticketing system. I keep getting the same copy paste response: *""With reference to your query, we have already escalated this to the relevant team. We noticed that the relevant department already working on your issue with case number [CASE NUMBER]. We request you to please reply back to our team for immediate resolution. Kindly reply to this email or contact us via Live Chat if there is anything we can assist you with.""*

[Here's a screenshot for half the conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/279456085885321216/927448327304400966/InkedILLITERATE_LI.jpg). I feel right stupid having this much patience.

I literally got this same email more than 7 times now. It's all the same copy pasted garble cock but from differently named bots. This is beyond infuriating for something so stupidly simple.

Do people still use Panda Mart still...? Or do you guys just use FoodPanda for... well, food?

I know I risk this post not being worthy or relevant to Malaysia or r/Malaysia but holy shit did I need an outlet. I am sorry.","About a month ago I tried FoodPanda. Came 2.5hrs later. No way of cancelling cos the whole app couldn’t even load the Help Centre. The food arrived with a receipt saying to prep food by when, so I know it had sat for an hour and a half. In between, estimated time kept changing and a rider was assigned 1hr before it was delivered. Rider went around the world but not collect my food. When I ask the rider, he said he immediately went to the store to pickup when receiving the request. 

Deleted it after that. Ordered in my office so my colleagues knew. And just recently, one colleague experienced status being delivered but food didn’t arrive. Went thru a few rounds of Helpdesk to finally get a refund. She sighed and said should have deleted it when it happened to me. 

I don’t usually like to outright say boycott something, but Panda is definitely something never to use unless ur life depends on it. || I've given up on using foodpanda. I've only ever used their service twice and both times they made me wait an hour for my delivery before canceling.

""Hi Customer, it's too bad but what made sure to wait till 9pm to tell you that we will not be taking you order. Good Luck and try not to starve.""

fucking dogshit indie company Rito games. Sorry, force of habit. || last time i remember, some foodpanda guy put a food in front of my house, i checked it and it's not ours. no one order foodpanda. and i put it there (outside because my sister say so) until 8 pm when my parent is back home. ask my parent who is this food for? they also dont know. at least tomorrow the person who order it get what they want. damn || nowadays, i only use FP to view the restaurant menu.

The amount i spent on Grab alone is ridiculous. || I can't speak for PandaMart (I don't really dare try this tbh) but the last few times I tried Foodpanda (which was some time ago - because I've stopped) yielded pretty poor experiences. In some cases it's stuff like wrong orders which may be the restaurant's fault (but it doesn't explain why I'm getting these issues way more often with Foodpanda than other services), but in some cases they just don't refund wrong/missing orders despite following through with all their processes. || I had bad experience with food panda also. Especially address part where it keep autocorrect even if I manually input my address. This cause driver to deliver to wrong place and problem cause etc. After that, I no longer use it coz of the address issues and discontinues after using grab food || My gf insists on using FoodPanda when she orders and it's always bad. The time estimates don't make sense, you never know where dlthe driver is and things generally take forever. 

I use Grab and it's usually good, and if something (rarely) goes wrong I get vouchers. || I guess they were only really useful during the *Panda*-mic.

*gets booed offstage* || Yes, they are quite bad. with foodpanda and these delivery apps I started to only use cash as my payment method. If my order is wrong or it doesn't arrive but marked as arrived, i just don't pay and don't need to worry about my money or go through the brain rot of a customer service.

Also, for ordering food, a good tip is to look up these restaurant on google, some of them have their own delivery system that is cheaper or you can contact them and get it delivered through lalamove (I do this for orders from arabic restaurants mostly).",3/1/2022,149,77,1641191397,malaysia,food panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/ruv3t7/a_rant_about_the_panda_of_food/

Let’s say for next year Hari Raya/Chinese New Year, we hire just Indians to slightly parodying/gimmicky reenact an ad. Just an all out cast of Indians!Sure some would say “there’s nothing wrong with that!”, kita-kan _”1 Malaysia”_ bro...but ask yourselves sincerely, do you _really_ think it would make a good impression, let alone receive positive comments? (BAM issue itself is enough to trigger hate) I’ve been viewing local ads be it videos/print ad etc, and there’s always so little Indian representation, sure Indians make up a very small percentage here in Malaysia, but what’s sooooooo difficult to throw in one(minimum) Indian representative? Ok lah don’t have to include in _every single ad_, but at least for god’s sake when it’s the only time to appropriately cast them, give them that small satisfaction lah. I just can’t fathom certain decisions/situations already, especially in these times. || As a half indian I don't really care but it is a bit odd they couldn't find one indian person for the ad. If there was a mix of chinese, indian and malays then it could be seen as celebrating multiculturalism (like a message that we can all celebrate indian culture regardless of race) but the fact it's an ad celebrating indian culture yet they couldn't even find one indian person for it makes it seem weird. || Not just people, they missed a lot of the festive elements i.e lighting of lamps, rangoli art, sweets, celebration visiting friends and family around..  looks like a last minute copy paste advertisement || I know this is not Fesbuk, but in case there's anyone confused/ triggered by the use of the word ""appropriating""....

The ad has stylised Indian music, with people in stylised Indian dress, but not one actual fucking Indian person. There's many ways to fuck up multiculturalism, and one of them is to caricature someone's culture, but to leave out the people themselves. || How hard would it have been to hire an Indian person? I don't get it. || Meanwhile on twitterjaya, people commented that its just a petty issue being brought up by woke people and proceeded to make it a race issue along the lines of 'kalau Cina dengan India boleh pulak tapi kalau Melayu semua salah' || Imagine black face issue in USA , where they hire white actor to play black character, either they really can’t find an Indian guy/ gal under their pay roll to play this character , or their effort stops at “eh we got all the props , that’s good enough.” || Forget arabisation. Americanisation go brrrrrrr || 😴😴😴 || culture appropriation is such a US thing. sooooo offended.

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.  


EDITED:   
Something like this, but there was another website : https://belilokal.thestar.com.my/  
it was made last year, i dunno what happen to that website though. || one more reason why we need more competition in food delivery service || I tot Rafizi Ramli already started one?

Meniaga app, I think || In my area, we have ""business WhatsApp group"" consist of few nearby Taman. Never need to use Food Panda, and you can also help your jiran. || I should have explain more on the profit part in my post. My thought is not that it will not generate profit to cover any cost, but to generate enough profit to cover the cost. The only problem is I do not have their audited report thus no way to justify if the 30% is reasonable or was it marked up.

Follow up to my post earlier. The F&B vendor clarified that she signed up for a promo on Food Panda unknowingly,,"Someone please correct my understanding here.

 You won't be on the front page after the promotion ends. So any  potential customers won't know who you are if they missed your front page when it first came out. Unless of course you participate in the program again and they spot it this time around. FP rack in the fees. In this sate case it's RM1400. 

Because you don't mark up, you hope your old customers become repeat customers. Or you get gazillion orders. Economies of scale. || so not only does food panda take a huge cut from the drivers, but also the sellers, and also charge customers a huge amount?

Grab Food atau Food Panda?,"Hello semua. Saya nak mulakan pekerjaan sebagai rider antara dua ni. Saya di Seremban. Manakah lebih berbaloi untuk dipilih dari segi pulangan harian, kelecehan bekerja atau lain2 hal. Harap boleh beri pendapat, terima kasih.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ms8j0t)","Hey, someone can add more stuff later or correct me if I am wrong, but afaik:

Foodpanda pay more, and it is easier since you only need to deliver in certain area only. Normally you can earn around rm3k to 4k+ (depend on place) monthly. But the problem is you will need to follow the timetable provided if you want to work. There is a limited amount of rider for each area, and once it filled up, you will need to do it somewhere else.

Grabfood seem more relax since you can switch on the delivery app anytime you want, but you will have to deliver stuff farther away. So you will need better Moto compare to FP. You don't have to deal with rainy day for GF since you can just switch it off when you want to, unless you are currently delivering something. As for pay, I think rm80+ in 6+ hours depend on place, which is slightly lower than FP. 

Personally I will pick Grabfood, mainly for the fact that you don't need to fight for space in timetable. And right now it is always rain heavily in the evening. If you don't want to deal with that, you can just switch off your apps. || Terima kasih kepada semua yang terlibat memberi pendapat. Saya amat hargai! || [removed] || With GF you can withdraw your income anytime you want, FP you need to wait the next Wednesday/Thursday (depending on what bank you're using) to receive your salary.



FP has a weekly performance evaluation, which affect your batch. Your batch determines how much you get paid per order, starting from the lowest which is rm4.50 (I think?) to the highest which is rm7. GF have none of that. || I also want to add regarding safety:


Foodpanda.

1. You deliver stuff ""locally"" or in certain area only. 
2. You will have a timer which will affect your performances, which will affect your batch, which will affect your pay. 
3. You will get used to road conditions in that area after a few weeks, so you can avoid potholes, dangerous area easily later.
4. You will have to work even in rainy day after you filled your timetable.
5. You will have to deal with cash and deposit them at the end of the day.

Grabfood.

1. You will have to deliver stuff farther away especially on weekend since most rider will take a break in weekend.
2. You probably someday will have to navigate in an area that you never been before. Beside the fact that it is dangerous for you to use phone (GPS) will riding, you won't know how is the road conditions in that new place until you get used to it.
3. You don't have to deal with rainy day or peak hours if you want to, or at least until you get better at it.
4. Since you may deliver stuff farther away, you have to make sure that your motorcycle is in good condition. It is very annoying if your ride broke down in the middle of somewhere that you had never been before.

Side note: you will have to carry cash for Foodpanda. Although it doesn't happen often, but there are cases where riders got robbed. My friend told me that in most cases, the perpetrator will ordered KFC/MCD up to rm300 and ask you to deliver to quiet place. You won't have to deal with this stuff since grabfood don't accept cash.

Oh and if you choose grabfood, you can choose between being a Halal rider or non halal. Check your area first. Most places it will better for being halal rider. In certain area, both can give you decent amount of delivery. If you work in that area and choose non halal, you won't receive order from KFC/MCD/etc. Which can be better since you don't have to deal with KFC/MCD order in peak hour which can delay you for a bit. || [removed] || Thread nuked.

MCJ : My Covid-19 Journey

Assalammualaikum dan selamat sejahtera semua. Hari ni saya nak share sikit tentang pengalaman saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19, kes yang ke 3xxx saya rasa. Maaf kalau saya terguna bahasa rojak dalam karangan saya ni. Saya tak pandai sangat buat karangan, nak lukis pun tak berapa pandai jugak. Jadi saya cuba share guna cara yang paling ringkas dan senang difahami.

Berikut adalah turutan perjalanan saya sebagai pesakit Covid-19:

11 Mac 2020

Jam 10.30 malam, saya dan Ekhwan bertolak ke KLIA untuk memulakan perjalanan ke New York selama 9 hari. Hanya kami berdua, anak2 tak ikut. Sebelum ada yang bertanya kenapa decide nak teruskan jugak perjalanan ke NY, baiklah saya mengaku je kat sini. Mula2 memang kami dah berbincang nak tangguhkan trip ni, tapi rasa excited tu kadang2 melebihi rasa takut. Plus masa tu US belum termasuk lagi dalam list negara berisiko tinggi. So kami pun macam ala2 confident la nak pegi, dan dah siap bincang segala macam precaution, dekat mana nak kuarantin lepas balik nanti dan lain2 lagi. Jadi kami pun pegi la jugak (huh, degei nooo anak mak niiiii).

12 Mac 2020

Sampai di JFK Airport. Terus ke tempat penginapan di 82nd St, 2nd Avenue. Guna servis limo di airport.

12 Mac 2020 – 15 Mac 2020

Memulakan acara jalan2 di NYC. Perjalanan dari satu tempat ke tempat lain menggunakan subway. Kami cuba mengelak dari pergi ke tempat yang sesak. Memulakan hari seawal pagi mungkin untuk mengelakkan bertembung dengan ramai orang. Patuh pada perjanjian, selalu sanitize/cuci tangan, jauhkan diri dari individu yang kelihatan tak sihat, jangan sentuh pintu kedai/escalator handrails, rajin mandi, jangan mengorat pelancong lain, makan dekat rumah je dan banyak lagi.

16 Mac 2020 -19 Mac 2020

Saya mula terasa sakit tekak dan demam. Tekak rasa kering dan pedih2 sikit. Tapi sebagai seorang yang ada sinusitis perkara tu macam dah biasa bagi saya. Seperti biasa setiap kali ada simptom macam tu saya akan kumur dengan air garam atau mouthwash, makan antihistamine dan kalau demam ambik PCM. Selepas 3 hari saya sembuh. Tekak dah tak sakit, demam dah hilang. Tapi, dalam tempoh 3 hari tu saya tak keluar rumah langsung. Lagi pun NYC dah start lockdown. Kami juga ada hubungi Encik Hanafi dari Malaysia Embassy di NY, minta nasihat apa nak buat kalau symptom saya berpanjangan, ke mana nak pergi untuk buat test, apa nak buat kalau airline refuse tak bagi balik. Dan call 311 (NYC Covid Hotline) untuk tanya apa perlu saya buat sebab saya ada symptom. Tapi susahnyerrr la hai nak get through the line. Sampai la baik demam masih tak dapat bercakap dengan doctor.

20 Mac 2020

Dah baik demam. Tekak pun dah ok. Tapiiiiiii….hilang deria bau, dan deria rasa. Again, ingatkan sebab sinusitis jugak. So tak risau sangat sebab demam pun dah hilang. Takde batuk, takde sakit dada.

21 Mac 2020 – 22 Mac 2020

Travel balik ke Malaysia. Sebelum balik, kami book homestay dekat Shah Alam untuk 2 minggu for self quarantine. Taknak balik rumah sendiri lagi. Taknak risikokan anak2, mak mertua, adik2 ipar, jiran tetangga dan 3L (Lola Lulu Luna yang gebuuuuuu). Sampai KLIA, ada screening by KKM. Sebab kami tak demam, jadi pegawai KKM bagi satu surat pink untuk suruh kitorang quarantine.

24 Mac 2020

Mulakan kuarantin di homestay. Ekhwan start demam dan batuk2. Ajak pergi test dia kata takpe, tunggu kejap lagi 4-5 hari sebab kami suspect maybe sebab changed of weather je dia demam tu. Makan PCM sepanjang demam. Dan meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Selain buat kerja office dari rumah, tengok Crash Landing on You. Awwww…kacak betul Hyun Bin

30 Mac 2020

Pergi MSU Drive Thru Covid-19 Screening Test. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test. Naso/oropharynx swab. Sekejap je dah siap.

1 April 2020

Pagi2 Ekhwan dapat result test melalui whatsapp dari Lablink. Negative. Saya belum dapat. Saspen jugak ni. Sejam kemudian kring kringggg dapat call dari Lablink. “Puan Yusneeda, saya ada sesuatu nak cakap ni. Puan bertenang ye”. OK. Dari intro tu dah tau dah apa dia nak cakap. Saya positive Covid-19. Lepas tu doctor terus explain kepada saya yang nanti pihak KKM iaitu doctor dari PKD (Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Petaling) akan call dan arrange ambulance untuk ambil saya dekat homestay dan bawa ke Hospital Sungai Buloh. Murung sehari semalam. Penat Ekhwan bagi kata2 semangat tapi saya tak layan. Haha. Yela mana aciiiii dia yang demam saya yang positif (eh, tapi kan dah demam masa kat NY).

2 April 2020

Jam 7 petang, ambulance sampai. Abang KKM lengkap dengan PPE jemput dan masih sempat bagi kata2 semangat. Masuk ambulance, tutup pintu. Nangisssssssssss…..haaa tu la mak dah kata tak payah pi, gatai nak pi jugak. Kan dah kena!! Dah la lama tak dapat jumpa anak2. Rindu anak tak? Mesti la rindu. Tapi, saya sedar saya kena bertanggungjawab 200% terhadap keputusan dan tindakan sendiri. Saya kena sedar tanggungjawab saya pada masyarakat jugak. Tak boleh mengeluh. TANGGUNGJAWAB. Itu penting.

Sampai hospital, terus ke Ward 7B. Tukar baju, mulakan prosedur. Doktor datang interview. Tanya sejarah perjalanan. Tanya semua contact yang pernah ada dengan saya. Part ni paling penting. Kena JUJUR. Sebab sebarang ketidakjujuran akan memberikan impak yang besar pada orang lain. Pada frontliners, pada seluruh warga KKM, pada masyarakat. Pada kerajaan Malaysian yang awesome (bodek sikit).

Jadi selepas habis sesi dengan doctor, kesimpulan yang diberikan adalah, kemungkinan besar saya telah mendapat jangkitan sama ada di airport, dalam kapal terbang atau ketika di NYC sendiri. Dan Doktor mengambil kira tempoh jangkitan adalah dari hari pertama saya mendapat symptom, yakni pada 16 Mac 2020. Maka ketika saya tiba di hospital, itu adalah hari ke-18 saya bersama Cik Corona.

Owh lupa nak cakap, saya juga kena update majikan tentang keadaan saya. Penting. Syarikat saya bekerja memang ada Special Taskforce untuk manage hal2 berkaitan Covid-19. Hai Ridhuan, hai Farina

Selepas habis bagi maklumat dekat doctor, buat chest x-ray dan ambil darah. Check blood pressure, body temperature dan oxygen level. Chest X-ray tu untuk tengok keadaan paru2 sama ada terdapat jangkitan atau tidak. Walaupun saya tak ada symptom. Menurut doctor, itu adalah prosedur. Sebab ada jugak pesakit yang tak batuk tapi jangkitan dah ada dekat paru2.

Jumpa kawan baru di ward. S, N dan KL. Baik2 belaka. Siap ada whatsapp group dah. Dan follow each other di socmed.

3 April 2020

Jam 5.30 pagi Doktor kejutkan untuk buat another swab test. Result mungkin dapat within 24 hours. Ok doctor. Saya yang menurut perintah. In the mean time, teruskan kehidupan seperti biasa. Dan sebab saya tak ada symptom lain selain loss of smell, saya tak perlu makan apa2 ubat. Saya cuma makan nasik dan segala macam makanan yang hospital sediakan je. Habis pulak tu. Haha.

Ekhwan sekarang dah jadi close contact, dia pun perlu hadir ke hospital untuk melakukan swab test lagi sekali. Dan beliau pun datanglah ke hospital Sg Buloh untuk buat test. Waktu saya tulis ni, result masih belum dapat lagi.

4 April 2020

Alhamdulillah. Latest result adalah negative. Jadi saya dibenarkan keluar. Dan WAJIB kuarantin diri lagi selama 14 hari untuk pastikan saya betul2 bebas dari virus sebelum pulang ke pangkuan keluarga. Tapi jika ada sebarang symptom sepanjang 14 hari, saya diminta untuk menghubungi pihak hospital dan PKD semula untuk memaklumkan keadaan saya. Dan saya pun balik semula ke homestay.

Sedih jugak tak dapat balik lagi ke rumah. Tapi lagi sedih kalau apa2 terjadi pada keluarga saya. Jadi saya redha dan reset balik tempoh kuarantin. Demi insan2 tersayang dan negara tercinta…takpe, kejap je 14 hari tu. Jom layan Money Heist pulak, sambil2 buat kerja.

Itulah serba sikit kisah saya. Saya bersyukur kerana Allah berikan kesihatan yang baik kepada saya, walaupun dijangkiti saya boleh sembuh tanpa sebarang ubat. Sebagai seorang yang telah pulih, saya sentiasa berdoa semoga Allah SWT memberikan kesembuhan dan memudahkan urusan pesakit2 Covid-19 yang lain yang sedang berjuang. Saya juga bercadang untuk menderma plasma saya, sebagai salah satu bentuk sumbangan dan berharap dapat membantu ramai lagi pesakit untuk pulih, insya Allah jika saya lulus segala syarat sebagai penderma. Semoga cepat sama2 dapat balik bersama keluarga.

Perasaan tak dapat berjumpa insan2 tersayang ni bukan main2. Saya mengaku ada ketika saya murung, salahkan diri sendiri kenapa tergamak menjadi selfish dan pergi jugak travel tu. Tinggalkan anak2. Percayalah memang setiap hari saya hidup dengan rasa bersalah tu. Tapi setiap hari jugak saya berpesan pada diri sendiri, ada hikmahnya semua ni berlaku. Salah satu adalah saya diberikan kesempatan berjumpa dengan insan2 yang berhati mulia, mengambil berat, tabah, ikhlas dan penyayang. Saya anggap itu satu anugerah di sebalik semua dugaan ini.

Jadi di kesempatan ini juga, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua yang telah membantu saya. Terima kasih yang tidak terhingga. Semoga AllahSWT sentiasa merahmati kalian semua.

"Actually any Malay accidentally ate pork, or Indian accidentally ate beef? What do you think about the meat?","Just curious. I am a Chinese and due to my believe in Guan Yin Ma, I actually can’t eat beef. My mom is very strict that I never take beef. But sometimes I accidentally ate them without knowing, and whenever I tasted the meat, a sensation of “how come this pork taste so nice?” rings in my head. And then I know this is beef. I don’t puke it out as my mom will do, if it ever happens to her. I will slowly chew the meat and take my time to appreciate the moment. I wouldn’t take another bite, but I enjoy my sin. Hehe.

How about the other races? Did you accidentally ate the forbidden meat? What is your view and moment?

Edit: wow, once Malaysians talked about food, we can’t stop. You guys even bring in alcohol and various wildlife to the party. Don’t eat panda ya. These are just memory of life, but this post doesn’t try to encourage people to try the food they can’t take for any reasons. Just sharing your story.

First stop was Hong Kong Disneyland and for dinner I ordered beef burger. I ate it and I swear it’s one of the best burgers I’ve ever had in my life next to burger Ramli special. 

Due to my curiosity, I then asked the chef what’s in it. It turns out that in order to make the burger extra juicy, they mixed minced beef with minced pork and cook the burger using lard (pork fat). This is not stated in the menu. The menu only wrote “beef burger”. 

Since then thinking back to it, I just think “this burger is so haram but it’s so good” || I am Straight but I accidentally ate cock. || Accidentally drank wine.

I dont think i am missing much by not having pork in my diet. I believe mutton taste the best of all meat thats halal but thats just my opinion. || Chinese here.

Once I was in N9 eating with my dad and his friends, I went to pick some meat and my dad caught me but I had already put it in my mouth. He told me to not eat it anymore. I thought it was just chewy and gamey with a weird taste. Later he pulled me aside and told me that was kera. I wasn't disgusted, but damn, it really sucks.

Had a taste of some hunters soup as well, my grandpa used to go hunting at his estate with friends and once when he came back with a squirrel and made soup with it and let me have some.

PSA: Price difference between FoodPanda and GrabFood,,"This screencap is from today 30/05/2019.

Grabfood may have very attractive subscription plans and promos, but ultimately their price hike is too much. If you have no promo codes, consider comparing prices as Grabfood will most likely be higher (approx 30%). This is consistent across more than three vendors I've personally ordered from so do your research as well. Sometimes even with promo codes, Foodpanda comes out to be cheaper. As Grabfood also commonly have a minimum, consider Foodpanda if you often do take out for one. Don't be blindly attracted by promos, as it's not always cheaper.

If you have a shopback account, Foodpanda is eligible for cash back as well.

If you are used to Grabfood, currently they have a voucher code that is rather good (EasyEats), thanks u/KuzaSasuke for the tip! But once this promo is gone, to Food Panda I will go.

TL;DR: **If you have no vouchers, avoid Grabfood at all cost.** || thats why I prefer standard fast food delivery. || GrabFood's item price is higher than Foodpanda's total. I have never used GrabFood, but from this it looks like I never will. || Would the difference be because of the Brown Sugar Warm Pearls? Or is the foodpanda order truncated? || Didn't know this one drink can cost me a full dinner of KFC for two || Which one provides better service? Never used either one before. || Good to know, thanks for share || Yeahhh grabfood is pricier so I dont prefer them. I use foodpanda more. || Tealive recently increase their pricing on GrabFood for some unknown reason, maybe because of the commission percent set by Grab which cause them to increase the pricing. I always use GrabFood because I also gain Reward point which can be used to buy deals either for GrabCar or other brands. || I tried More Fun once.

GrabFood Tips,"Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Wrong delivery

&#x200B;

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

&#x200B;

* You can get partially refunded for an order that was wrongly fulfilled.","Was expecting tips on ordering or using GrabFood but found 2 cases of complaints instead. || r/unethicallifeprotips || My friend cheated by FoodPanda.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

Why do I have higher Grab food delivery rates?,"Why am I seeing higher delivery fees than my friend’s? We are ordering from the same restaurant, we are at the same location (encircled 2.9km away), and we tried it at the same time (so demand/surge/whatever should be same). We both use android phones. We both do not have the Grab Unlimited subscription.

I already tried asking customer support about this, but first the chat was ended by the agent after reading my message, and second the ticket I raised has been stuck there waiting for a response for days already.

I just want to know the reason why.

Only differences between me and my friend that could affect this which I could think of are: 1) I am on the Gold tier while he is on the Member tier, 2) He is local Malaysian.","I remember seeing similar news in Singapore a few years ago and there was outrage about it in the Singapore subreddit, just putting my tinfoiled hat on but I think Grab's algorithm differentiates their users based on their spending habits and tiers, higher tiered users or frequent users are probably marked as less price sensitive so they will just mark up the price in hopes that you will stick on using their service and avoid considering alternatives || Did your friend have the annual subscription? || OP I recommend you to repost this to r/Bolehland as well. Try to retitle your post to include the fare difference since many commenters here did not read the description and misunderstood your post, I think about half of the commenters here just assumed that you were complaining about the expensive fees

Also if possible try to combine both images into one to show the price difference side by side to make it easy for people to see the price difference

The post about the price difference went viral in r/Singapore which prompted Grab to give a response 3 years ago, honestly I don't want Grab to get away with this || They charged you more so Tan Chong family get richer || Grab's magical algorithm is supposed to calculate delivery fees based on distance, availability of riders, the business of the restaurant and probably a few other factors I'm not aware of. How any average end user can tell if it's not also programmed for blatant profiteering, we'll probably never know, but I wouldn't put it past them given their history. || Grab Unlimited user here. Only RM5 a month, and 70% of my orders are free delivery most of the time, on top of the price cuts i get everytime i order from a store with Hot Deals tagged. I don't order that frequently, at most once to twice a week. 

As for food panda, haven't touched them in years. || It's all the algorithms, it's not some conspiracy theory. The calculation is based on time, availability of drivers, weather, traffic.. Basically a multitude of data points that change by the minute and effect the calculation... || Same here. I have two grab accounts, the one I often use has Gold tier, the other is just left at home for family members to use. The one with Gold usually shows a slightly higher fee during peak hours. The algorithm probably assumes a frequent user would be willing to overlook a higher fee. Same thing with Foodpanda. || For agoda, i notice constant price difference between my android phone and my wife's iPhone, with the iphone always cheaper.

Not sure phone brand related or because i always book with the wife's phone || I have a similar experience as well with Grab Food and Shopee Food.

Grab unlimited free delivery not working ,"Hello, I’m visiting Malaysia and downloaded the Grab app for rides and food. I got Grab unlimited free trial and the tourist pack but the free delivery does not add on and all the offers (like 30% off specific stores) does not work. Is this an issue others face too? ","I'm not sure abt the tourist pack. But Grab has imposed more T&C to enjoy their 'discounts'. Did you order above a min amount and at the right time? Cuz during peak hours, they can decide not to offer free delivery. 

Even the free delivery only applies to selects stores 🤡 || I'm on Grab Unlimited too, and there's fine print which applies. 

It's not free delivery, but an RM3 discount on delivery fees for orders totalling RM20 and above. Also the 35% Grab Unlimited discount only applies for restaurants labelled Hotdeals.

Looks like you did get the RM3 discount on delivery above, as there's no way Saver is only RM0.50. || There’s all sorts of inconsistent rubbish on grab. Huge discounts that are capped at only a few RM etc etc… just marketing to people who don’t check and now they more or less have a monopoly || Grab apparently saving you from diabetes || Did you ever resolve this? I’m having the same issue now.

Never encountered before during previous subscription. Double checked with a family member and theirs have the RM3 off from grabunlimited while mine does not. || That is so odd, I’m not use to it being like that in my home country. Thank you for letting me know || Ohhh so the  0.50 is with the RM 3 off? That makes sense it just doesn’t display it thanks. I don’t know why offers like buy one get one 50% off or other store specific offers does not apply though. I add to cart, it says discount applied then it says offer not available. || I wasn’t going to actually order the boba haha, just the top seller item so I can show the discount does not apply || I ended up messaging them about it after I gave in and placed an order and then it got sorted out after that. Maybe give their customer service a message? || where did you message them? They dont have a proper customer service platform.

So you placed an order first and later got refunded the delivery fee?",19/1/2025,6,10,1737262433,malaysia,grab delivery,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4qr44
GRAB getting worse ☹️,"I have been using Grab for YEARS but recently,Ithe service has gone from bad to worse..Delivery charges are ridiculous..Drivers now accept ONLY if ride faress are high..Then they cancel 🙄..Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded..Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours..Food & mart prices are higher than outside market prices..And the choices are so limited..Some drivers are RUDE..It's come to the point,I avoid Grab as much as possible..Also,they accept the rides,then DON'T move till i get so fed up,I cancel 🤬","You can read up on “platform decay” or Enshittification. What you’re describing is baked into the business model - they were never sustainable at low cost, good quality service.

For what it’s worth, I now only use foodpanda for food delivery and take airport limo from airport but for the most part we’re stuck with a monopoly. || I really hate drivers trying to make us cancel instead of them cancelling. They just hang around and not moving. I was not giving up, I used another phone to book a ride, let the first driver wait 2 hours before telling them they lost 2 hours of their lives waiting for me to cancel || BOLT BOLT BOLT, all the older and smarter drivers have switched to Bolt/indrive/maxim. || A few days ago, the fare for pickup from my house was RM60+ and rising. Then I changed the pickup location to the opposite street, my neighbour's, and the fare dropped to RM30+. 

THEIR ALGORITHM PURPOSELY PUT HIGHER PRICE IF PICKUP FROM HOME! || Just look up the distance between your location and your destination, deduct 20% from your total fare and divide it by the KM. That's how much the driver gets per KM. If it's less than RM0.90 - RM1/KM, be prepared to encounter problem like getting stood up. 

Based on my own experience as a part time driver, out of 30 jobs,maybe only 2 or 3 i got RM1 or more/KM. On average it's RM0.70/KM sometimes even RM0.60/KM. That's the reason the service is getting worse. It's proportionate to the price which is super cheap. If you choose Grabcar Plus, it's very rare for this to happen if any because of the higher price. || So far I have good experience for Grab Food but I guess I live in an area where there are a lot of delivery riders. I order a lot of Grab food a month (circa RM700-800) as I get some sort of allowance from company (due to remote work). 

When it comes to Grab ride, sometimes I can see that it is a few drivers which tends to spoil the whole bunch. They started behaving exactly like how taxi drivers were hated upon in the past. They basically became numb to their customers. From driving like hooligans and maniacs to simply blocking traffic and stopping indiscriminately just to drop off a passenger. || I think ppl talked about how Grab started the way they did because of their massive funding, right at the beginning.

Get ppl hooked in their services, by sustaining massive losses.

Now they're just trying to break even. Don't think they're profitable even?

The business model was never a viable one. || They had to start making money 1 day ... can't be making losses forever. || For food I completely agree it has been nothing but downhill. I don't use grab car so can't comment... for airport runs, use the train it comfortable and fast. Around town using mrt. || I *just* started to drive for Grab. I don't think I can turn-off auto-accept, although I don't cancel on anyone (when I get tired, I just go offline and finish my current job).

> Sometimes,they take forever to accept if location secluded

I mean... that's fair, isn't it? 

> Fares now TRIPLE during peak hours

Really?

GrabFood customer service is so bad,"I’ve been using grab as my food delivery service for a while now. I just cannot stand their service, like a while ago i placed an order which was cancelled right after by the restaurant. I never got my refund and they wont do anything about it. Or when i accidentally order something and it wont let me cancel. And if you tell me to just use their help centre well it sucks. Everytime it brings you to their AI chat which doesn’t understand anything.
I would switch to another service but there are just none. (Foodpanda have more charges for their order)","I had bad experiences with both apps but Grab definitely takes the cake. Ordered dinner for my family which the rider refused to pick up because he was 'fixing his bike'. 

Refused to cancel so someone else can pick it up. Cant cancel, cant contact the restaurant, cant get in touch with support without a long wait time. 

Eventually the restaurant closed and my food was lost. 

When I finally get through to grab, they offered me RM 4 compensation over the RM 100 bill, which we waited for an hour + and with hungry kids who had to eventually be given sandwiches. 

I told them to shove their pathetic excuse of an apology and stopped using their service as much as possible. 

All these boils down to a lack of regulations/oversight by the government. Too many 'e' companies have free reign on what they deem to be their responsibility towards their customers. || Not much choice.

Best is Foodpanda, second Grab, ShopeFood  is worst. || Oh man. I hate Grab so much. One of worst customer service I ever come across and definitely worst in Malaysia (before Ninja Van was worst, but at least they have done alot to improve over past year) …

Ordered Grab food delivery which was obviously eaten by my driver (drink cup half empty, missing items, security seal broken). Messaged Grab and was assured a refund. GRAB THEN CHARGED ME AGAIN (double) INSTEAD OF A REFUND!

Of course, the AI Bot Help Centre was useless, FB/Insta Messenger no reply, Help Centre no reply.

Finally today after over week, after posting all over Grab Social Media links, got reply saying matter referred to another team … who will (hopefully) reply me in a week.

WTF. How hard is it to get a refund when they obviously and wrongly OVERCHARGED?!?!?!

Orders being jammed at their centre and not sent to the merchants kitchen || Maybe can write to their management or complain to small tribunal court? || Foodpanda have more charges like their service tax and processing fees.

Let's hear your suggestions. Motorbike culture in Malaysia.,"So just recently came across another video of abang M. Rempit running a redlight and deservedly getting into a life threatening accident. I say deserved because, yeah FAFO. I have zero sympathy for those.

This led me to think about how many times I had to swerve my car in my own lane because these idiots are reckless and care about nothing except themselves. And I do so not because i'm afraid, it's because I love my car and having them scratch or hit my car is not ideal, why because they can't pay for the damages anyway.

So I'm making this little post right here to ask about what sort of suggestions that you have that might hinder this sort of behavior, I'm talking laws/rules/road legislation or what have you. I'm also fully aware that it's basically 0 chance it gets implemented, I'd just like to hear your suggestions on this boring rainy day at work. I'll start.

Anytime a dashcam/road CCTV catches any perpetrators running red lights and/or any ridiculous shortcuts they take that may put others at risk. Their license is revoked. If you work for grab/shoppeefood/foodpanda etc. Anytime a full proof video is submitted, they lose their job instantly. They work and represent the company and I think they should be liable what their staff does on the job. I feel that if the food delivery platforms apply this tactic we would see a huge decrease in these idiots thinking they can get away with whatever they want. Let's hear your ideas. 

","I think it's mainly got to do with the law where if a motorcycle gets into an accident with a car, regardless of who's actually at fault, the car driver has to lay up || Ah yes, contribute to self bashing. Then again i did choose to ride i suppose.

Our biggest problem would be our baseline ethics. When everyone has the tidak apa cincai attitude the problem will never go away because ""just this once. Lol jk"". Enforcement alone can only do so much, really.

How do you even begin to change a cultural norm? Even getting people to stop littering is a challenge. || I did notice that before I went to Uni in 2017, even a ruralish state like Terengganu. No one ran redlights. After I came out during 2020. I believe it was when grabfood and foodpanda became a thing. Foodriders were the first to really run redlights. Then plenty of people followed. In OKR going to work daily. 3-5/10 motorcyclist run redlights everytime. But they take the side of the road when they do. Genuinely its a cultural thing.

I ride myself daily back and from work. Have I ran redlights? Yeah, but only the one in front of my house. But its rare. Like 1/1000 of the time.  The culture of it really is there, monkey see monkey do. Its the same as people tailgating emergency ambulances. I like the idea of taking away licenses when caught on camera. Its another culture of enforce it though. || It’d be nice to have a way to incentivise waiting at the light or make waiting more tolerable through better traffic management. 

Everyone should have access to mobility and I totally understand how income and education are linked to how our country is currently engineered to build rempits but I’m not sure if the stick over carrot method will do enough to prevent them from forming the habit. 

Maybe a law abiding rempit messiah will show them the right path one day. || am i the only one that thinks that mat rempit culture or dangerous motorbike/cars are just the way malaysia does it natural selection? 

OP is searching for a way to decrease or stop this behavior but sadly OP is right that there will be no change. 

1)rules do not get enforce (so what if they run a redlight)  
2)in an accident with a car , they get compensation anyway (based on experience with polis)  
3)the damages they cause , they just claim they no money and refused to pay  
4) the polis dont act on the video even if you have them. (like seriously)  
  
this is the malaysia way of life. || do what we did in SG, make motor cycle license cheap to attend but hard to pass. || Sadly whatever idea we propose no matter how good is it, will never be enforced due to political suicide.

I can imagine there will be protest and riots on street if do something which prevents motorcyclist from langgar red light. || You see, you bang

/S || I too agree (with one of the comments below) this came about more frequently when grab food, food panda/ bike delivery started. While it will kill many jobs, for sake of saving lives, I think replacing bike delivery with drones will instantly solve this.

And then channel these redundant people to work on something else. || Unfortunately, because we practice a racialist political system, every problem is seen with racial lenses.

So even if we know how to fix the problems with law breaking motorcyclists, there is very little political will to do it.

Most law breaking motorcyclists are identified as coming from a particular race. This means that politicians who are self-proclaimed champions of this race will defend them till the cows come home.

And every time anyone complains about it, the will be seen as enemies of that race.",9/7/2024,4,27,1720507291,malaysia,grab delivery,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1dyvpg8/lets_hear_your_suggestions_motorbike_culture_in/

Thoughts on shopee food,"I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment? Shopee food app is stupid hard to navigate though, maybe I just need that learning curve, so wanna get a sense of if its worth it before I commit to anything.

I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad for shopee food, it isn't, I've brought them to tribunal court for their shit delivery twice.","Always have used only Shopeefood. Cheaper and can use coins. The other two expensive lah || Shopee Food used to allow combination of 2 vouchers (1 for food discount, 1 for free/discount on delivery) which made is mad cheap!

This is sunny day, no traffic and yet can't find any driver. Also I have to wait for an hour for it cancel automatically as it can't find any drivers. || Not enough vendors on ShopeeFood in my area. || Only the pricing is different maybe, the rider is same.

i have my mcdonald here cost 1 ringgit for delivery but shopee is 3 ringgit (example lah aiiyoo)  
but shopee is dominant for its discount/voucher,cant deny that  
for tracking order,grab no.1 for me,when rider move its follows along while shopee will skip skip their route (although i could just close-and-open the app to track *accurately*) || It will be cheaper until it become big, then they will jack up the price the like the two services. At that time, hopefully there will be another upcoming service which will be cheaper to attract customers || Is this true for most cases?

"M'sian Grab Driver Eats Cake Which Was Damaged During Delivery, Garners Sympathy From Netizens | WeirdKaya",,"I believe that tipping culture when done through 3rd party apps (Grab and others) will invite more problems. Such as a) decentivise companies to increase wages. b) increase the number of people opt in gig economy (which I think should not be for individuals that CAN work a normal office job) and c) I feel like it gives incentives for the driver to grade us.

Correct me if im wrong but if I don't tip the Grab driver or give low tip, can they know? Wouldn't that make them rate me lower than 5* even though my behaviour is civil while in their presence. And if I'm rate lower than 5*, then I would get bad/unsafe drivers. Is that logic correct or am I just overthinking this system of both rate the driver and the passenger. || Sad ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|28915)

Wish the grab drive more successful delivery and get customers who tip big in cash. ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26558) || I want to feel bad, I do. Knowing the struggles of having no choice but to work with what you can do and can earn in this ever increasing price hikes economy. The customer can't fully be at fault too, maybe it's a birthday cake for someone so it has to be presented nice, but then if you really adore the person you would have went out and bought it yourself tbh. If they reject it cause they can't put it on Instagram for clout, shame on them.

However, we don't know how the drive drove. Knowing how majority of the grab drivers are speeding past you in lanes, taking corners dangerously, rushing orders cause the restaurant was late knowing they survive on number of trips made.

There many sides to the story that we can't see. Was the person who ordered the cake entitled? Possibly. Was the rider going fast and the cake moved a lot in the bag? Possibly. We just don't fully know what happened is what I'm saying. || [removed] || Story sounds fake. Customer ask him pay back RM 60 for ""damaged"" cake and he do it and wife just happens to capture him on video eating cake sadly? || [deleted] || its kinda sad to see that rider eating a deformed cake

its not his fault though, just trying to make ends meet only for his family

and the customer whos order it, its not wrong either || >Muhammad Fadzil added the RM60, which he had borrowed from his sister, was a huge burden for him as it was the end of the month and his child’s baby formula had run out.

In the grand scheme of thing, the cake issue is irrelevant.

He needs a different job. || We already have a tipping culture via service tax if you think about it.

Price of food at a restaurant is ingredients, time to make and serve, (maybe environment) That's why your Char Kueh Teow at the road side cost like RM7 but in restaurant like Little Penang at KLCC/IKEA is RM18+. That's on menu price.

Then the service tax is for? Their tips obviously. But somewhere along the way owners decided to pocket it too. Anyone who work as a wait staff don't see any extra money when the shop is busy. Just more fatigue at the end of day.

It's the same shit with that credit card charge too. It's supposed to be for the store cause they pay for that particular service, but who pays for it? The customers obviously. || As a grabfood rider, I don't care much if my customer didn't tips me (grateful if they were) its didn't affect how i rate them as customer.

"Food delivery regulars (Grab, Food Panda, etc) are they actually cheaper or more expensive?","Disclaimer : I'm new to food delivery, yes I'm super late to this scene, just trying to understand 

I hear people (heavy users) saying ""it's cheaper to order"" so decided to try it out. Mostly using foodpanda, I see jacked up prices everywhere like at McD for example. Then you need to add on delivery fee. Compared to buy-at-retail it's so expensive! 

I see some vouchers which can reduce price (if you meet the threshold) and maybe if you subscribe to the panda pro it can reduce delivery fees right? But even after all that, I find that prices aren't too much better compared to dine-in 

Sure you save time and parking, and convenience. But in pure cost of meal, I see not much difference, and generally it's more expensive, esp when you run out of vouchers.

Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points? 

P.S. I notice Domino's seem to offer good pricing compared to actual store price, like they don't hike up much, but who else actually?","It used to be cheaper a few years ago with their crazy promo (They were operating at a loss to build customer base). Nowadays it’s more expensive if you don’t “subscribe” to them. 

Even if you opt with their subscription, you actually have to be smart with your purchase to ensure it ends up cheaper. Eg: Breaking down a RM50 order into two so you can apply the 50% off(capped at RM12.5) twice. || You're mainly paying the premium for the convenience of the food coming to you rather than you going to the food. Taking into account things like fuel price and parking, 8 times out of 10 it is definitely more expensive than whatever other options of eating the same food from the same place. I say it is only cheaper once you apply the necessary vouchers and order for a group. There's also a hidden payment of your conscience because your order caused the rider to be on the road, whatever weather and distance and how many red lights he passes just so you can eat. || Speaking as a frequent Grab Food & sometimes Food Panda user.

You are paying a premium in exchange for convenience. Whether that convenience is worth the hiked-up price is entirely your decision: it does add up if you order frequently, and even more so if you order multiple items per order. I often order meals for myself and my parents, each order costing RM50-60 on average. There are vouchers but those are also conditional e.g. minimum order amount of RM25, or limited to self-pickup and so on. I also use my accumulated Grab points to offset the cost sometimes but that’s a once-in-a-few-months occurrence, nothing to shout about really. || Grab points is almost worthless now. Barely can earn points these days. They've revised a few times on the earning mechanics. 

Ordering via grab/foodpanda in most cases is more expensive. You need to actively compare prices in-shop and grab/fp to know the diff. 

There may be instances is cheaper (vouchers, hot deals etc) but not as common anymore. 

These days i rather go out tapau unless i need the convenience. || >Am I missing some trick or secret method to get cheaper price by delivery? Do heavy users get reward points?

It is chaotic and differs between shops. You just have to go touch grass to figure out which ones are cheaper. You can roughly apply the rule - if the restaurant is doing well without delivery orders, they won't bother to reduce the deliver menu price to attract more customers.

I don't think it will last forever though, Grab for example has been running at a loss. If they decide to stop trying to attract customers then delivery price should always be more expensive. || I think the general rule is that the restaurant prices on delivery apps will be higher than in-store. I don't know about most places, but I mostly order from my regular shops which I also frequent in person (yes, I don't try many different things, I'm boring). It's usually RM6-8 (including delivery) higher on either app (Grab / FP) than if I were to go and buy it myself. 

If I use one of my Grab Unlimited vouchers, that same order will still be RM2 more expensive on Grab compared to if I were to go there.

If you're a heavy GrabPay user (which means actually reloading into their e-wallet and paying from there), you can accumulate Grab Points which you can use to offset the cost of food. I haven't done the calculation, but I don't think the points to cash ratio is great. || It’s only cheaper when companies are fighting with competition to gain marketshare, so they have lots of funds to offer enticing promo codes.

When the campaign ends, things aren’t that cheap because there’s always a markup in the food price, on top of the high delivery fee. || Grab unlimited member here, it's only more worth it if you order for at least 2 ppl or more. Then the discounts on selected food vendors will be more worth the convenience. || In long term, no reason for it to be cheaper. Restaurant makes less on a delivery order, and you have to add the delivery fee. || More expensive.

What's a good monthly allowance budget for a University student?,"Malaysian University student. Lives at a hostel, even on weekends. Needs money for food, be it whatever eateries the University provides, Deliveries from restaurants via GrabFood, FoodPanda, etc., or just the convenience store. Maybe even needs money for laundry. Then, maybe they need to buy some equipment for their studies, say they need a camera or a new computer. What's a good budget for this student to get through the entire month?

Not including tuition fees, leisure activities, and any other unforeseen events that requires their money.","Man the way they teach math at school is useless... They should provide more real life questions like this.

Just my assumptions. Put into Excel spreadsheet and adjust according to own circumstances:

Hostel room with single person: RM600 (RM300-400 if sharing, RM1000 for more luxurious options)

Food: RM10 * 2meals * 30days =  RM600 
Filling snacks such as Milo and Biscuits budget = RM100
[Optional] occasional feast = RM200
Total = RM700 - 900

Utilities:
WiFi RM50
Electricity + water RM50
Mobile data RM50
Total = RM150


[Optional] Transport:
Parking = RM70
Fuel = RM60*2 refuels per month = RM120
Total = RM190, round to RM200 for safety



TOTAL:
Low: RM1350
Mid: RM1750
High: RM2250


I might have missed something. Just put into Excel sheet and edit as something comes to mind. Have some savings, and adjust excel sheet as expenses pop up. Reduce expenses if income not enough to support.

I assume you're asking for your kid, if so remember to consider if your kid travels back to hometown to meet you. If yes, need to consider in budget and maybe increase a bit for kid to have more leeway in spending. Ask him to report his spending and adjust spreadsheet if you're worried your kid bazir. Use the spreadsheet to find any suspicious spending. Budget using highest expected spending. Always budget enough, don't budget expecting to skip a meal or something. || I got 750 allowance monthly , but I save by doing laundry at my parents house , going back at weekends the occasional gas refill by them so I extrapolate roughly to 1.2k. Should say my location is Bangi. || For me, food alone is RM30 a day with a bit of leeway to go a bit higher or lower(Not more or less than RM5). This is only possible because I eat 2 times a day and I make sure I eat heavy enough to not lose or gain weight.

Basically, what I do is buy food from the closest Uni eateries and pay 8-12 for my first meal and 20-25 for grab food for my second meal.   Have to be smart to pick food from Grab to get the bang for my buck portion wise.

So, that's roughly RM900 a month.

IF other things like leisure stuff and necessary self maintenance stuff included, maybe 1200-1300 all together. || Hah like that , 900 enough ? Can cook your own food ? I live with 600 including rental in 2014 to 2022 || Lives at Nilai Sep - Jan 22/23, rent + bills utilities around 200 per months.

Break it down to simple categories:  
Food : 2 x 15 x 30 = RM900  
Phone bill : RM50  
Entertainment (cause they are in uni, let them have fun ) : RM1000  


RM2k a month is a good amount. I used to get this as my monthly stipend when I was in uni between 2011-2015 and it was enough for me, granted I live with my parents.

[AMA] I'm an ex food deliver rider,"Worked for both Grab and Foodpanda as a food delivery rider before. At separate periods of course, not at the same time as that is not allowed.

Ask me anything that you always been wondering about this job, will answer it to my best knowledge.

Update:

Thanks for all your questions! I noticed a few questions that has been raised quite often so I'm going to quickly put a FAQ here:

**1. Payment Scheme?**

Grab is based on RM5 for the first 5km then RM0.50 per km for every additional km after the first 5km. There is no limit on distance and therefore riders can earn more per order but it will probably only be 1 to 2 orders per hour.

Foodpanda is based on hourly of RM5 per hour (increase RM1 for every level up in rank) and with an additional RM3 per order. There is limit of 6km within the vicinity so riders can do shorter distances and get an average of 3 to 4 orders an hour.

After factoring it out, the average earnings will even out.

&#x200B;

**2. Difference between Grabfood and Foodpanda?**

Other than the payment scheme mentioned above:

Grab - flexi - can choose when to turn on or off the app and your location - so yes you can work anywhere anytime. Good for riders but can be a nightmare for Grab as they cannot control where the riders are - so you end up with some places with too many riders and some places none.

Foodpanda - based on shifts (minimum 4 hours) which you will select one week in advance when the schedules are released in the riders app every Wednesday. You are confined to only 2 locations that you chose when you register as rider. You cannot simply change location suka hati, if you want then inform HQ but it is a permanent change and not according to your mood everyday. This is to ensure there is only a certain amount of riders in an area during certain hours (peak/non peak) so that there will be no over-crowding of riders with some no orders at all. This is what I like about Foodpanda.

&#x200B;

**3. Why are riders so reckless and always running the red light?**

Unfortunately, if you are asking this, you are most likely from a privileged position as much as my statement may slightly annoy you. I don't as I do not actually need the extra money so I am more relaxed, but the riders who have mouths to feed at home and the only breadwinner in the family may feel the pressure to keep hustling and every minute counts to get the next order.

Not exactly saying I support this and yes it endangers them and others but unfortunately the drive to want to earn to provide is higher than the fear of death which is sad. If our country is better in managing cost of living and the economy, riders will naturally not feel the need to work so hard and be so pressured every minute in order just to earn a simple living. Think about it.

Grab Malaysia denies reducing base fares for delivery riders,,Base fares. What about scaling fares?? Lets say minimum fare under 2.5km is rm4. Then maybe the next thing would be extra rm1 for each KM from the base fare. If the scaling fare is reduced from rm1 to 70 cents.

Is there other Food Delivery better than Grab?,"Is there any other food delivery that is better than Grab? The reason why I am using Grab is because it is tied to Grab car which I mostly use, and since they share the wallet, it's convenient.

However, recently I am noticing something odd with how their app shows which shop is ""available"" or which is ""out of delivery area"", which I find concerning. Whether you're a customer ordering food, or a shop selling food, or even the grab delivery rider, I think it's something to look at. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking at other food delivery apps.

A bit of back story, I wanted to order food from a favorite shop, which is relatively near to my place. Unfortunately, I couldn't order as the shop is ""whited out"" stating it is ""out of delivery area"". However, I noticed some shops that are of similar distance are available. I asked their Twitter support as to what's the reasoning for this one, and they said that it's either lack of delivery riders in the area or ""due to weather"". It wasn't lunch time so it wasn't peak hours, nor was it raining at that time. They said that this is how the app automatically handles such situations. And because of this logic, the app suggests shops that are > 10km away, however it chargers delivery for the same amount as that of when the shop is just near.

This to me seems like a red flag if I am a food seller or a delivery rider on their platform. If I'm a seller, I would be mad if I found that the app is blocking me from getting orders on the pretext that the app assumes there's no delivery riders nearby. If I'm a delivery rider, I would end up having to deliver to people that are so far away, only to be paid a measly amount as delivery.

It doesn't make sense to me as to why they have the need to disable the shop. Why don't they just put a premium on the delivery charge like how they add premium to grab car whenever it's peak hours? It's their delivery riders' prerogative if they want to take the delivery or not. The shop gets their orders, the delivery riders gets paid extra, and the customer gets the food that they want, everyone is happy.","It could be that the particular restaurant disabled the GrabFood app from their side due to reasons e.g. not enough staff to handle both dine in customer orders and food delivery orders. || [deleted] || Try shoopee food, some riders/shops move over there( enjoying the honeymoon period), that might be the reason :-s || Try Beepit || Try AirAsia, Gojek and Food panda || I've seen AirAsiaFood. do they offer BIG points when you purchase from their platform?

Proposing a community food delivery service,"With the recent news about the Satay auntie receiving only RM0.24 for over RM1,400 sales on FoodPanda (after deducting all sort of commissions and unknown deductions) and news regarding restaurants owners complaining about the high commission on food delivery platform, I was wondering is it possible for us as the community to develop a new platform to help the smaller restaurants and us, consumers?

The restaurants listed in FoodPanda and GrabFood had to mark up their prices on the platforms as it is rumoured that the commission can be as high as 30%. The marking up of the price will then be transferred to us, the consumers. Even with the promo codes provided (50% or 40%), the discounted price is still the same as the original price as if you buy it straight from the restaurant or maybe RM1 or RM2 cheaper. 

Then the delivery fees has also been increased since the starting of MCO 3.0. All these factors have considerably increased the cost of my meal even though I am trying my best to do my duty by staying at home! Every meal will cost me more than RM10 now! All these have made me wonder if the delivery platforms are just taking this pandemic as an opportunity to garner more profit.

So, here I'd like to ask if anyone in this community is knowledgeable in the delivery industry that can contribute some of your opinions or advices on is it possible for this community to start a brand new delivery service platform? One that does not put profit as their primary goal but instead one with restaurants and consumers' benefits as their primary goal. (or maybe even extend to the drivers as well is possible)

Whoever interested in this community project is welcomed to comment!","Whose gonna pay for the cost? Nope. Not viable. Yes 30% is cut throat price, but there is a reason why it was charged that high. One thing if its a monopoly business, but grab do have fierce competition. So i'd say that 30%, although high, not unreasonable. || The RM0.24 profit is because that person registered for some promo that's why got deducted that much. Next time better know the entire picture first.   

And for your idea, no profit, who's gonna do it for free? Nothing is free in this world. || If the driver runs into accident, you gonna pay for their medical bills?

If the driver is found with misconducts like stealing food, spitting into food, you gonna hire a lawyer when sued by customers?

You have a system that can coordinate the traffic between restaurants and drivers? 

You can streamline the whole ordering, delivery process?

You have a dedicated customer service fleet when customers call in to inquire on late/missing/incomplete orders?

There are so many more problems that are way more complicated than the ones listed.

It's easy to assume that grab/foodpanda are freeriders who are sucking away a big chunk of the profit that should have gone to the restaurant/driver when you don't even understand the function they have.

It's a fair system, nobody is forcing these restaurants to opt in to these delivery services. They do it because it's benefiting them. If they find the cost outweighing the benefits they can opt out anytime they want, there's no commitment. Some restaurants even have their own website and delivery service, what's the problem?

Every once in a while there will be a post exactly like yours, pointing out the same problem and proposing the same solution. Consistently, there's won't be any update and the person would likely go silent after awhile, presumably after they did 30 minutes of research online and became aware of what they're up against. 

If you have the resources, and I mean a lot of resources (grab has 7000 employees, I can't count out all the professions needed to make what they do possible if I try), then by all means go for it, though I have my doubts considering how high the barriers to entry are in this market. I'd love to see a nonprofit delivery partner, more competition means these big players will try harder to achieve market domination, and that translates to more promotion for customers and better terms for the restaurants. But then I'm contend at how the situation is now, competition is there and there's not yet a monopoly, more players are joining the game (AirAsia food for example). || Nothing is free and those services are optional .They can opt ouy if they wanted . Who is going to pay for riders salary , app maintenance , organize the data etc ? . || Nice try, new account intern for the food delivery start-up. || I believe there is an app tthat listed all gerai / kedai near your around, community driven. But problem with that is that you wont know if particular stall is open / not, nor it didnt open any delivery services.

Mostly just to help you discover some restaurant that you might overlooked in your area. You still have to go there yourself or contact the stall itself.

Let me google the app / website and get back here.

(Remember to keep the SOPs as you buy from them!!) We may be in lockdown right now, but the effectiveness of this map will be even greater once we're out of this period :)

This Google Maps layer compiles these stall's locations for us to easily locate them and drop by to support these stalls. (For now, only limited to KL and Selangor.)

**WHICH HAWKERS/STALLS?**

* Hawkers/stalls with owners, especially the elderly, who are less digitally savvy and cannot provide online delivery through apps like Foodpanda/GrabFood
* Hawkers/stalls that struggling to survive/are on the verge of closing down due to a lack of customers during this period

(You can start by looking at the ones in your own neighbourhood ;) )

E-Tunai Rakyat: A primer,"You may have read the announcement that the government has [selected Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets are selected for the e-Tunai Rakyat initiative.](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tng-boost-grab-selected-etunai-rakyat-initiative)

Basically, in the Budget 2020, the government will give every Malaysian above the age of 18 but earning below RM100,000 a year a **one-off** RM30 initiative to use e-wallets between January to March 2020.

I'm a big advocate of e-wallets, thus I'm writing this post to encourage people to grab this RM30 money from the government. I mean who doesn't like to get money from the government?

**What are e-wallets?**

E-wallets work just like physical wallets: you earn money, you withdraw it and you put it in your wallet/e-wallet to spend. Unlike physical/fiat money though, you won't end up one day opening your wallet and seeing only RM5 in there and wondering where it went. Every single sen spent is tracked, what shop, where, when, so you can better monitor your spending. 

It's also safer in that if you lose your physical wallet, any thief that stole your money can spend it anywhere they like and it will be very hard to trace. Your e-wallet in Malaysia requires a pin or biometric unlocking to be used, so thieves can't use it, and even if you lose your phone, your account balance is tied to your phone number, so once you get a replacement phone, the balance is still the same.

Also Bank Negara and the Malaysian government is pushing for e-wallets because digital currency can be traced, and all merchants, and e-wallet users must be registered, so it will be hard to play hanky panky with this kind of money, compared to fiat money that can come from anywhere and be spent on anything without the authorities knowing.

**So how do I get my RM30?**

First you have to choose between any of the 3 e-wallet options: Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grabpay. I will briefly go through the differences below, but the process for registering to get your RM30 is the same.

1. Download the app on your smartphone.
2. Register your phone number and get confirmation of your account.
3. As an additional security requirement, you must upgrade your account to a 'premier' one (for Boost and Grab), and key in your IC number. All three apps also require you to take a selfie, for I guess verification purposes.
4. Once your IC is linked to your e-wallet, you can then apply for the e-Tunai Rakyat program, **which will begin on the 15th of January**.
5. The system will cross-check your data and see if you've applied before or not, and will give you the RM30 if you haven't.

That's it! You can now spend that RM30 at any registered merchants. Find the logo and they'll scan your code or you scan their code and money will exchange hands!

If you want to topup/withdraw money into your e-wallet, you can use online banking or link your Credit Card or Debit Card.

Source: [ Touch 'n Go FAQ,](https://www.tngdigital.com.my/etunairakyat) 

**What are the differences between Touch 'n Go, Boost and Grab e-wallets?**

The three companies have different perks to encourage use. I use Boost and Grab a lot, but I haven't used Touch 'n Go thus I may miss out on some key data, but I should be able to give broad generalisations about each e-wallet.

**Boost** used to give a guaranteed cashback on every use. I will buy my lunch and pay using Boost, and every transaction used to give me RM0.10 to RM1.00 every time at random. They've removed this over the past month and have converted it into Boost coins, which can be used for cashbacks, but it's not so fun any more. But Boost is generally more game-showy and encourages you to spend these coins into entries into competitions to win a car or something. Also they are really banking on you using your Boost money to spend on mobile topups, because these purchases give lots of Boost coins.

I generally use Boost at restaurants and food stalls. Like I get my Stuff'd lunch, or drink Tealive and pay using Boost.

Also the first time you upgrade your Boost account you get an RM5 cashback as an incentive.

**Grabpay** is more straightforward. Every spend gives you points, which you can spend on vouchers and cashback. Grab links directly to its Grabcar and Grabfood (and Grab Delivery and Grab Mart), so if you use those features regularly, then it deducts directly from your e-wallet to pay for these services. Grab points are generally used for discounts on your next purchase, like RM3 off on your next ride, or RM6 off from your next order.

I am least familiar with T**ouch 'n Go e-wallet,** but after installing it and using it once to buy an RM10 Starbucks, I'd say the promotion works differently as in it doesn't have points, but it does encourage you to spend at selected vendors which will give you discounts. Also anecdotally, I think a lot more vendors have Touch 'n Go signs compared to Boost and Grab.

**Is the Touch 'n Go e-wallet the same as my Touch 'n Go card?**

Unfortunately while they share the same name and are of the same company, they are different things, but they can be linked. You can link *one* Touch 'n Go physical card (I know many people have more than one, myself included) to your Touch 'n Go e-wallet, but you cannot topup your physical card using your e-wallet. You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong.

I've been rambling long enough. Thank you for reading, and happy getting your RM30 to spend! I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'll answer it to the best of my abilities.",""" You *can* however directly link your physical card directly to your e-wallet, so when you tap your card at the toll or at the parking, it will deduct from your e-wallet balance instead of from the card. I have not used this feature so I may be wrong. ""

Unfortunately, this only works on selected tolls. || Honestly I only use TNG ewallet due to its speed to launch/topup and scan. Also RFID and Paydirect works directly with the app itself making reloading such a breeze (without service charges)

+ RM10 per ticket for TGV really helps my budget going out for movies and also cashbacks and promos.

Downside is that can't use Paydirect on PLUS highway ( heard next year will be different ) and can't top up your physical TNG card.

I mean c'mon, I was at Singapore and can use my NFC on my mi9t to topup my Autopass card (need the app) seamlessly. Why can't we do that here!

Tried using boost early on but it wasn't that stable (took a while to launch,topup scan etc and has downtime)
I don't use grabpay because there's no incentive for me to do so. || Thanks for sharing this post OP ! || i earn more than 100k a year. would the ewallet verify with lhdn if i sign up for it in the app? || The only reason I use TnG is for RFID/Pay direct at the toll i go through every day for work. There aren’t many incentives for now but the reload process is almost instant. Have yet to try Boost (didn’t like that I can’t transfer money out of the account - not sure if that’s changed recently) and grabpay doesn’t seem to be accepted everywhere yet. Nice to see we are moving towards a cashless society :) || I use touch n go ewallet on a daily basis because i hardly carry cash anywhere I go. I dont like the idea of withdrawing money at Atm and the most i carry in my wallet is rm5.

My spending habit changed tremendously. I only eat out at a place that accept ewallet/card payment. I only make withdrawals if i decide to go somewhere that will require cash. || Boost reverted policies (changing cashback to coins) really making me wana uninstal the app, but then i got rm10 out of the blue, i mean i had to postpone my thought for now. || Touch and Go presented our company with an additional problem, used to be we blindly allow our sales and service team to claim TNG receipt, now we have them to itemize their spending and restrict it to only toll and parking if they want to use the app (one dude claimed over 1k via TNG, we found out he use the e wallet to makan) || TBH they should just unify TnG card and TnG eWallet. Saves so much trouble. || As I'm a heavy user of RFID/TnG Paydirect, I'll definitely choose TnG e-wallet.

GrabFood Tips,"Case #1

Before Hujan

&#x200B;

7:15pm: I ordered food on GrabFood (""GF""), due at 8:00pm. RM40 but down to RM20 because of promo code, and free delivery.

7:30pm: \*rain starts

8:10pm:  Food hasn't moved yet. Restaurant says food is ready but no rider. I call Grab's hotline and they say there's no rider active in the area but will try to manually locate one and call back.

8:20pm: No call back. I call a GrabExpress (""GE"") (the Transport thing on the Grab app) and immediately get one. RM10 for the delivery.

8:40pm: GE rider goes to pick up the food at the restaurant.

8:45pm: GF emails/SMSes me to say that my money has been refunded as the food cannot be sent. If they can't get a rider after 90 mins, they refund you and... it's up to the restaurant what to do with the food.

9:05pm: GE rider arrives with food.

&#x200B;

* I got the food for free and only paid RM10 delivery. 
* I told this to Grab and they said it's fine.
* You can save a riderless GF order by using GE. Same should apply to Food Panda and other food deliveries, and with any other delivery service.
* Downside is I only ate after almost 2 hours.

&#x200B;

Case #2

Wrong delivery

&#x200B;

Friend of mine had his order fulfilled on time, but they sent the wrong drink instead. He ordered coke (shows on his GF app) but got sprite instead. There's no way to rate your food order or complain about the restaurant (you can only rate GF for the delivery), so he immediately sent a complaint on the Grab app. Within 1 hour they refunded him RM5 as they deem it wrong.

My Issues with GrabFood,"Enraged by the recent events with GrabFood, I would like to share some of my issues with them that has been on-going for a while now. It makes me angry on how simple some of their issues are and how easy it is for them to solve it.

Please note that I am a regular customer, with multiple orders a week sometimes daily, spending a fair amount of money for the service. Its quite shameful that Grab has deteriorated its quality of service ever since Uber decided to forgo its services and just buy Grab shares.

Here are a list of reasons why Grab is utter shit (even compared to Foodpanda);

**1. App/System Error**  
There has been times after Ive ordered and I put my screen on the process tracking page waiting for the whole order process to be updated and after a while of nothing being updated, upon refreshing the app I get notified that the order could not be placed/restaurant not available. Why do I need to refresh the app like that? In the tracking page, sometimes its already at ’Heading to Restaurant’ and them suddenly after a while it just cuts off. Are the orders on a timer where they just update without any input? But Ive also had orders where it was just stuck on ‘Order Received’ for a long time then suddenly my food arrives. 

**2. Multiple Orders from Same Restaurant**  
Sometimes I’ve mis-ordered from a restaurant which resulted in me ordering twice from said restaurant. I don’t know why grab can’t offer to the restaurant to group the order into one if its within a certain timeframe instead of making it in 2 orders where the customer has to pay for 2 delivery charges. Paying for 2 delivery charges is an issue but what makes it worse is the fact that the 2 orders will have 2 delivery people. Why? It seems like such a waste of time for the customers as sometimes one of the drivers will need to stop by someones house to drop some other order which can take an additional 20-30 mins. Not only does it waste the customers time, it also uses an additional driver  where that driver could be taking a delivery for a different area instead.

**3. Lack of Customer Support**  
I can’t remember if Grab used to be able to have the in-app chat to Customer Support (like food panda/uber eats) but I remember them having a button that will call straight to Grab Customer Support where they can try sort out the orders or cancel them. Nowadays, not only is that function not there, there is no way for you to contact customer support from the app alone. If you try to use the app it will link you to some FAQ crap that will basically tell you to contact the driver of food about the order status. I think its not the customers or the drivers responsibility to call the restaurants to find out whats happening regarding the order. I had to go to GrabFood facebook to find the number to call customer support. Even on their direct website I couldn’t find anything relating to their contact info. I don’t know if Grab is trying limit their costs by making it very hard for their customers to contact support and thus less refunds from the orders or by reducing customer support people in general or what but customer support in a service industry is super important in keeping your customers notified and happy. This is a super fail from Grab.

**4. Rating System**  
I find that there is literally no use in rating the drivers and the restaurants. Literally check the restaurant listings now. Most of the restaurants listed have 0 ratings from people. A small number of them only have 1-5 people rating the restaurant. It seems like every time I rate an order it just doesn’t seem to update to their system. I thought this type of info would be very useful to the customers since they can filter the restaurants based on rating but it seems Grab doesn’t really care.

**5. Food type Classification**  
This is one of the easiest things to do right. I don’t understand why its so difficult for them to just classify the food properly. Whats the use of the search and food type function if the food typing is wrong or not classified?

**6. Filter for Food Pricing**  
The filter for food pricing is also not correct. For example i.e. If I choose the cheap pricing, I get Sticky Wicket which is a pub with medium pricing food. There should be a threshold or at least define the ranges of the pricing.

**7. Phantom Restaurants**  
Sometimes theres restaurants that appear in the list that are either 1. Not open or 2. Don’t have any food inside it. Why list this restaurant at all? They should be unable to have their restaurants active until they have some sort of food listed. Its just cluttering the list.

**8. Loading Restaurant List**  
I don’t know why but since a couple weeks back, every time I try to refresh/load the restaurant list the time to load is so slow, sometimes trying to load will lag the app. It seems the issue only happens to iPhones since my friends who use Android don’t seem to face it.

**9. Limit of Previous Order History**  
In the app, there seems to be a 10 order limit on the previous order history. If for any reason people need to claim for  their meal expenses, pay back a friend for a previous order, verify their statements or even just check what food they ordered from a particular restaurant past the 10 orders they did then they’re shit out of luck. After contacting them on Facebook to ask if they could email me directly this months order history, their exact reply was “The orders are not stored in our system for a long period of time. The history you see in your app is the same we have access to.” Their reply to my email, “Please be advised that currently the order history only visible for last 10 orders. However, we will take this concern positively and highlight it to the higher management for future improvement.” Great job Grab. Why limit to only 10 orders?

**TLDR - Things that Grab need to improve on**  
- Rating system to work 
- Have Rating system for each menu item (Like Ubereats)
- Need to be able to invite other people to share payment on meals
- Should be able to favourite a restaurant or meal or food
- Maybe group together certain restaurants near each other for group ordering (Maybe only one order basket needed /Pay slightly extra for delivery charge but not additional standard delivery charge per shop/One driver needed)
- Classify their food properly (food type and pricing)

Called grab support and they also confused why she blamed me of kidnapping her in one of the busiest street. Crazy lady.

so a few things can happen. they ignore your request and just do whatever; or they actually do what is asked; or they just straight out say no. lelz...

Thoughts on shopee food,"I recently purchased shopee food for the first time, from my experience delivery is a bit slower compared to grab but it seems to have more options and discount a bit cheaper. Then again I did it on 12.12 which is the sales period.

So far I've only tried grab and food panda, I'm slow to adopt to new apps like these, but it seems... okay? What is a general Malaysian thoughts on shopee food and what app is best at the moment? Shopee food app is stupid hard to navigate though, maybe I just need that learning curve, so wanna get a sense of if its worth it before I commit to anything.

I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad for shopee food, it isn't, I've brought them to tribunal court for their shit delivery twice.","Always have used only Shopeefood. Cheaper and can use coins. The other two expensive lah || Shopee Food used to allow combination of 2 vouchers (1 for food discount, 1 for free/discount on delivery) which made is mad cheap! Now only 1 voucher is applicable || it's straight up shit.I understand if it is rainy or traffic holiday and no drivers can be found or not drivers wants to take the order. This is sunny day, no traffic and yet can't find any driver. Also I have to wait for an hour for it cancel automatically as it can't find any drivers. || Not enough vendors on ShopeeFood in my area. || Only the pricing is different maybe, the rider is same. Rider that I know he wear food panda cloth, bag, but when I ordered from shopee food, food panda arrive🤣. I use multiple platform and choose which had voucher or cheapest option😆 || i use both grab and shopee,mostly i used grab because delivery fee are cheap compared to shopee  
i have my mcdonald here cost 1 ringgit for delivery but shopee is 3 ringgit (example lah aiiyoo)  
but shopee is dominant for its discount/voucher,cant deny that  
for tracking order,grab no.1 for me,when rider move its follows along while shopee will skip skip their route (although i could just close-and-open the app to track *accurately*) || It will be cheaper until it become big, then they will jack up the price the like the two services. At that time, hopefully there will be another upcoming service which will be cheaper to attract customers || Is this true for most cases? I agree, grab ever since after mco it's been a huge rip off, delivery fee increase randomly, the discount is not really a discount, and the mark up is becoming insane. 25 bucks for a fried rice or something. || That seems to be an issue in my area as well, but then I'm also tired of all my grab vendor I've been using the last 3 years...

Experience with Malaysia's food delivery service,"Hello all! I would like to know if you guys have a very bad experience or good ones with some of the food delivery services available in your area?

I just had one with ShopeeFood delivery ytday. I ordered from a Mcd some burgers. When it came, we ate it, then just found out that one of the burgers were missing. So we decided to collect back the already eaten burgers packaging and take a photo to send for a refund. Today, it says the refund is cancelled, because of insufficient proof. I was already like ""how do I show proof of something I don't have?"". So then I called the customer service line (had to wait 10 mins Btw) and ask for details. The person explains that I needed to take a picture before eating and show all the things I get, which I guess make sense to always check what you received. Still, it's so frustrating to get punished for this. I'm one burger short, hungy, no refund, and angy! 

I've had missing items when ordering from Grabfood but never got any problem with the refund. it's almost always instantly approved. So what about you guys? any horrible ones you had?","Even in business, you are expected to inspect your goods ordered when delivered.

Do u think they will entertain u? || Top tip: Don't use Shopee Food || [deleted] || Don't try this in big season during cny they can't handle it || [deleted] || To be fair, it is difficult to prove that you did not receive the burger since you didn't take any photos upon reception.

* Always check the URL for errors/inconsistencies/poor grammar and look out for accessible contact information.
* Do not believe 100% online reviews and be sure to ask the seller if you have any questions.

# 4.1  E-Commerce Scam (Shopee/Lazada)

**General tips:\[Source:** [Shopee Online Shopping Safety Tips](https://shopee.com.my/m/online-shopping-safety-tips?smtt=0.0.9)**\]**

* Shopee/Lazada will never ask for OTP.
* Shopee/Lazada will only contact users/sellers via official channel such as Official FB page or through official app notification, and this includes announcements for campaigns or prizes as well as distribution of vouchers.
* All finance-related activities should be strictly done through Shopee/Lazada App and Web only, and when in doubt, check with the authorities or their customer service
* Always keep count on the orders you have really made from both platforms

**What you should do if you are scammed on Lazada** by u/sasa86 **(may be applicable to Shopee or other platforms):**

1. Compile all screenshots, especially the part where the 'seller' promises refund.
2. Make a police report, claiming fraud.
3. Forward a copy of police report and compiled screenshots to Lazada, as the platform strictly prohibits sellers from conducting sales outside the platform.
4. Once Lazada confirms receipt of said report, forward it to the 'seller' together with a copy of the police report AND state that you will pursue legal action if the money is not refunded by XX days.
5. When making statements to police or Lazada or 'seller', be calm and not be too angry when 'seller' replies to ask you for more time or delay, just shut him off and say sorry, please refund by XX days, then don't say anything more than necessary.

# 4.2  E-Commerce Scam (Carousell)

**General tips:**

1. For expensive items, always insist on COD or Carousell Protection
2. Make sure transaction takes place on Carousel and not WhatsApp
3. If item is too cheap, then it's good to be true and likely a scam.
4. For sellers, recommended not to sell to a user based in another country
5. Check seller or buyer's ratings and go for the **lowest star review** instead of 5-star
6. Report to police as well as Carousell so they can suspend the seller's account
7. Make offer and wait for it to be accepted so that you can leave a review to warn others

# SCAM TYPE 5: JOB SCAM

[Source:https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malaysia\/comments\/r7sa6v\/is\_this\_a\_scam\/](https://preview.redd.it/g41ll5h9vfn81.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7423de44ee1764b668a37769c55b1f0a071fa2)

**Prevention and Identifying fake job offers \[Source:** [Randstad](https://www.randstad.com.my/job-seekers/job-scams/)**\]:**

* Search for jobs advertised on reputable and legitimate employment websites, such as JobStreet (still have to be cautious)
* Red flag if money is involved and you are asked to transfer money for medical check, work pass application or to attend the job interview
* The company has no website or official/corporate social media account
* You did not apply for the job
* The job is too good to be true and job description is unclear or too short
* Poor use of the English language with multiple typos and grammatical errors in the job advertisement or text messages, or “job offer” that starts with “Hi dear…”
* You found the job posting in a random social media community
* They ask you for your personal information such as your mobile number or ID photo on messaging platforms

**Job scams on Lazada and Shopee:**

* Shopee/Lazada confirms that there is no such role as “Online Purchasing Agents” or ""Lazada Affiliate Marketing Group"".
* **Shopee Job Scams:**

1. Scenario 1: [A job offer that requires you to pay to get paid](https://imgur.com/AzcTjaT)
2. Scenario 2: [The same job scam with an upgrade](https://imgur.com/Xw3OAte)

* **Lazada Job Scams:**

1. Case Study 1: [Purchasing products to “increase traffic and clicks” and promising commission](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/lu8tn6/update_scamming_through_lazada_please_help/) by u/liamkohwil
2. Case Study 2: [Fake Lazada Affiliate Marketing Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/mh9s18/prevalent_scam_to_watch_out_for_lazada_affiliate/) by u/roboukiiscool

**How Lazada scam works by** u/roboukiiscool **(applicable to Shopee too):**

1. You help them buy 'products' for them in which they will pay you a small % of commission on (in this case 8%)
2. After purchasing the 'products', you send them a payment slip as evidence of you actually purchasing and they'll supposedly pay you back the original amount of cash you paid for the product AND the commission they promised.
3. It starts from small amounts such as rm 5 --> rm 25 --> rm50 --> rm100 and you get 8% commission for all these transactions, sounds like easy money and they gain your trust already.
4. The higher cost transactions will be around rm500 and this is where they'll start to test how far they can take you, they call this the 'vip lounge' or something else, so you thinking you're earning easy commission money through making such sales, you let your guard down.
5. The scammers think they have extracted enough from you and give excuses on why they cannot reimburse your cash and commission anymore, late on payment, etc etc  and block you after that.

**Prevention \[Source**:[Investright.org](https://www.investright.org/fraud-awareness/avoid-investment-fraud/common-investment-scams/) and [RHB Bank](https://www.rhbgroup.com/others/fraud-awareness/index.html)**\]**

* Cannot meet you in person and avoid video chats.
* Profess their love early on in relationships and flood you with affectionate messages.
* Steer the conversation toward finances and ask for money.
* May ask for your nude photos or perform sexual acts in front of a webcam and then threaten to spread the photos to family, friends and strangers if you stop sending them money.
* Often another form of parcel scam, in which the scammer will claim to send a parcel with valuable items or money and promise commission/jewelries to the victim but need to pay for “courier service”.

# SCAM TYPE 7: ROAD SCAM

# 7.1  Road Scam (Oil and Smoke scam)

**Modus operandi (**[Source](https://www.pressreader.com/malaysia/the-star-malaysia/20130918/282205123576843)):

* A motorcyclist drive beside your car and points out to your wheel to indicate a problem and alarmed, you pull over to the side of the road.
* This motorcyclist then ""helps"" to call a ""mechanic"" to get your wheel  examined. The ‘mechanic’ would go as far as **disabling the braking system**  while ‘checking’ for the cause of the smoke.
* After doing so, he’ll then  ask you to test your brakes, which are now not functioning. Being ""helpful"", he offers to help you get a new but **very expensive** spare part (most likely the old part is cleaned and brought back as ""new"").

**Prevention:**

* Don't let strangers fix your car/motorcycle and call your car insurance company.

# 7.2  Road Scam (Tow Truck scam)

**Modus operandi (**[Source](https://worldofbuzz.com/7-common-road-scams-malaysia-need-beware/))**:**

* Scammers would cover one part of the road with oil, causing drivers to  lose control of their car, ultimately skidding and crashing it.
* Within  minutes, these tow trucks would appear and offer to tow your car for an exorbitant  price and pressures you into agreeing, saying how you’re obstructing  the road etc.
* However, instead of towing it to the workshop of your choice, they may secretly tow it back to their own workshop and then extort money from you, otherwise they will not ‘release’ your car.

**Prevention:**

* Do not let yourself be pressured and insist on using your own car insurance company's tow truck service.
* [Case example](https://says.com/my/news/malaysia-tow-truck-scam)

# SCAM TYPE 8: CHARITY SCAM

https://preview.redd.it/mqktx39gvfn81.png?width=199&format=png&auto=webp&s=71e30f5bbc30b54d54eef60c647153f7b51dcc11

**Modus operandi (**[Source](https://www.pressreader.com/malaysia/the-star-malaysia/20130918/282205123576843)):

* Often scammers will exploit a recent natural disaster/crisis,  pretending to work for a legitimate charity and play on your emotions by claiming to collect for a cause that will secure your sympathy, for example sick children.
* Socmed posts, going around town or from one eatery to another, outside LRT/bus stations, morning markets, shopping malls etc etc holding brochures/folders or newspaper clippings to convince you of their legitimacy. May even dress up as a monk.

**Prevention** [Source](https://loanstreet.com.my/learning-centre/how-to-identify-fake-charity-collector-malaysia)**:**

* Request to see a permit letter as only charities with [permit from PDRM](https://asklegal.my/p/charity-asking-donations-street-soliciting-restaurant-legal) (House to House and Street Collections Act 1947) are allowed to collect street donations.
* Religious organisations such as madrasahs or tahfiz schools, prior to ""kutipan khairat"" they must first apply for a letter of approval from each state's religious department such as [JAIS](https://www.astroawani.com/berita-malaysia/kutipan-khairat-tanpa-kebenaran-mais-akan-diambil-tindakan-oleh-jais-98046) or [JAIM](https://www.hmetro.com.my/mutakhir/2021/09/750231/jaim-banteras-kegiatan-kutip-derma-secara-haram), failing which they may be fined or face imprisonment.
* Contact the organisation directly, ask questions as well as a receipt. Red flag if they can't do the latter two.
* Donate items or time rather than cash if you wish to help orphanages/old folks' home/NGOs

# SCAM TYPE 9: SCRATCH & WIN ([used to be rampant but may make a comeback](https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2018/07/388814/scratch-and-win-syndicate-dupes-consumers-soap-perfume) )

**Modus operandi** **\[Source**: [Straitstimes](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-still-falling-victim-to-scratch-and-win-scams-in-malaysia)**\]**

1. The crooks approach the victims and ask them to try their luck with a scratch card.
2. In  some cases, victims may receive calls about winning a “contest”. They  tell the victims they have won a mystery prize and ask them to go to an  office to find out what it is.
3. When  they arrive, the con men reveal the ""prize"", usually cheap electrical  goods. The victims are offered the chance to win  a more substantial prize, and asked to hand over cash in advance to cover bogus costs such as ""taxes"".

# SCAM TYPE 10: HAJJ/UMRAH PACKAGE SCAM

**Prevention \[Source:** [PDRM](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1931912393485725&id=161086313901684)\]

* Do not fall for cheap Umrah packages, especially those offered on socmed or WhatsApp (ex: RM2000 for haj and umrah which is unrealistic price after permit, accommodation, transport and food costs are taken into consideration).
* Check [https://www.motac.gov.my/en/semakan/umrah](https://www.motac.gov.my/en/semakan/umrah) for a list of licensed and approved travel agencies that offer Umrah packages.

**How do loans work \[Source:** [Hong Leong Bank](https://www.hlb.com.my/en/personal-banking/campaigns/duitsmart/financial-scam.html)**\]**

* There will always be an official document (printed or digital) which discloses clearly your loan details
* You will never have to pay any sum upfront as it is illegal for a lender to ask for pre-payment
* Find out who the borrower is and be sure the loans are from [licensed financial institutions](https://www.bnm.gov.my/list-of-licensed-financial-institutions) since they are regulated by the central bank and therefore the safest option or iKreditKom app by KPKT(Kementerian Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan) which allows people to check whether the lending company is legally registered before making a loan.
* Licensed financial institutions and/or banks **DO NOT** appoint or engage **third parties or agents** for the process of securing loans **\[Source:** [ABM (Association of Banks in Malaysia)](https://www.abm.org.my/media-room/press-releases/item/295-be-cautious-and-vigilant-against-scams-involving-stimulus-package-and-relief-measures-announced-by-bank-negara-malaysia-and-the-financial-industry-during-covid-19-outbreak)**\]**

**Red Flags \[Source:** [Hong Leong Bank](https://www.hlb.com.my/en/personal-banking/campaigns/duitsmart/financial-scam.html)**\]:**

* A lender who has zero interest in your credit history, and ads that say “No hassle-fast money guaranteed” or “We don’t care about your credit”.
* Legitimate lenders will only approve loan once they accessed your credit history.
* The entire loan process takes place via WhatsApp or socmed
* Upfront payment: Some scammers claim you need to pay a processing fee due to bad credit health
* Pressured to act immediately: Scammers may pressure you to give personal information or send money before providing proper documentation

# SCAM TYPE 8: INHERITANCE SCAM

[Source: Malay Mail and PIDM](https://preview.redd.it/vrevi00ium381.jpg?width=451&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff1f59e1cbb3c334aa56277dbbd86914a2b175da)

**Modus operandi \[Source:** [scamwatch.gov.au](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/unexpected-money/inheritance-scams)\]:

* A scammer may contact you out of the blue to tell you that you can  claim a large inheritance from a distant relative or wealthy benefactor.  You may be contacted by letter, phone call, text message, email or social networking message.
* The scammer usually poses as a lawyer, banker or other foreign  official, and claims that the deceased left no other beneficiaries.
* Sometimes the scammer will say you are legally entitled to claim the  inheritance. Alternatively, they might say that an unrelated wealthy  person has died without a will, and that you can inherit their fortune  through some legal trickery because you share the same last name.
* You will be told that your supposed inheritance is difficult to access due to government regulations, taxes or bank restrictions in the  country where the money is held, and that you will need to pay money and  provide personal details to claim it.

**Red flags/prevention \[Source:** [scamwatch.gov.au](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/unexpected-money/inheritance-scams)**\]**

* May look convincing and use official-looking letterhead and logos, but will usually contain spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.
* Size of the supposed inheritance may be very large, sometimes many millions of dollars.
* You are asked to provide your bank account details, copies of identity  documents as verification, and to pay a series of fees, charges or taxes  to help release or transfer the money out of the country through your  bank.
* Do an internet search using the names, contact details or exact wording  of the letter/email to check for  any references to a scam – many scams  can be identified this way.

**How to avoid** (credits to u/PRSXFENG):

2. The ships from address is usually invalid (00000 postcode), so you can't return it for refund.
3. 1TB storage drives are still quite expensive, you're not getting a RM15 1TB USB drive, it's a scam, the drive will show 1TB when plugged in but you'll loose data soon, so compare prices with well known brands.
4. Seller usually give a lot of free gifts
5. Seller usually has a bunch of useless keyword texts thrown in like FREE SHIPPING, FAST SHIPPING 24 HOURS, LOCAL SELLER, TRUSTED, HUGE DISCOUNT
6. Check 1 star reviews for call-outs (eg, h2testw)

8. Seller name is usually a mash of letters that looks like someone mashed their keyboard.

# SCAM TYPE 14: LAZADA SCAM

**How the scam works and what you should do** \[[Source: Lazada](https://www.lazada.com.my/helpcenter/how-to-protect-yourself-from-scams-12783.html)\]: 

* Scammers lead you to a phishing site and gain access to your personal details shared. 
* Only participate in contests that are officially conducted by Lazada on their official channels 

**Lazada Scam # Type 2: Job scam** 

**Case Study 1:** **Purchasing products to “increase traffic and clicks” and promising commission by** u/liamkohwil: [Thread: “Update: Scamming through Lazada. PLEASE HELP](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/lu8tn6/update_scamming_through_lazada_please_help/) 

**Case Study 2: Fake Lazada Affiliate Marketing Group** by u/roboukiiscool: [Thread: “Prevalent Scam to watch out for: Lazada Affiliate Marketing Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/mh9s18/prevalent_scam_to_watch_out_for_lazada_affiliate/) 

**How the scam works by** u/roboukiiscool: 

1. You help them buy 'products' for them in which they will pay you a small % of commission on (in this case 8%) 
2. After purchasing the 'products', you send them a payment slip as evidence of you actually purchasing and they'll supposedly pay you back the original amount of cash you paid for the product AND the commission they promised. 
3. It starts from small amounts such as rm 5 --> rm 25 --> rm50 --> rm100 and you get 8% commission for all these transactions, sounds like easy money and they gain your trust already. 
4. The higher cost transactions will be around rm500 and this is where they'll start to test how far they can take you, they call this the 'vip lounge' or something cringe, so you thinking you're earning easy commission money through making such sales, you let your guard down. 
5. The scammers think they have extracted enough from you then they'll come and give excuses on why they cannot reimburse your cash and commission anymore, late on payment, transaction did not comply etc etc . Basically just ignore and block you after that. 
6. You lose high amount of money from the 'product' you were supposed to be reimbursed back. Not to mention, the 'product' probably doesnt even exist so there's that. 

**Lazada Scam # Type 3: Making transactions outside of Lazada platform** 

**How the scam works and what you should do** \[[Source: Lazada](https://www.lazada.com.my/helpcenter/how-to-protect-yourself-from-scams-12783.html)\]: 

* Scammers block your contact after receiving your payment, with no delivery or refund issued. 
* Off-platform transactions **are not protected** by Lazada, so always buy and transact within the Lazada platform.

**What you should do if you are scammed on Lazada** (by u/sasa86): 

1. Compile all screenshots, especially the part where the 'seller' promises refund 
2. Make a police report, claiming fraud 
3. Forward a copy of police report and compiled screenshots to Lazada, as the platform strictly prohibits sellers from conducting sales outside the platform 
4. Once Lazada confirms receipt of said report, forward it to the 'seller' together with a copy of the police report AND state that you will pursue legal action if the money is not refunded by XX days 
5. When making statements to police or Lazada or 'seller', be calm and not be too angry when 'seller' replies to ask you for more time or delay, just shut him off and say sorry, please refund by XX days, then don't say anything more than necessary

# SCAM TYPE 15: CAROUSELL 

[Source: https:\/\/www.carousell.com.my\/p\/scam-be-aware-of-this-people-and-this-kind-of-email-141458605\/](https://preview.redd.it/pm8pbfgfqm381.jpg?width=404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97bcba4982ecfb98c06ee83834c08be227f7d964)

**How the scam works:**

1. Scammers typically insist for conversation to take place on WhatsApp instead of Carousel and once payment is made, they will block you. **\[Case Study:** [Has anyone here gotten scammed on carousell before](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/qcgkz2/has_anyone_here_gotten_scammed_on_carousell_before/)**\]** 
2. Scammers claim that they have overpaid and that you need to refund them **\[Case Study:** [Beware of this scam](https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5124969/all)\]

**What you should do:** 

1. For expensive items, always insist on COD or Carousell Protection
2. If item is too cheap, then it's good to be true and likely a scam. 
3. For sellers, recommended not to sell to a user based in another country
4. Check seller or buyer's ratings and go for the **lowest star review** instead of 5-star
5. Report to police as well as Carousell so they can suspend the seller's account
6. Make offer and wait for it to be accepted so that you can leave a review to warn others

Always ask for registration of that investment scheme and if they fail to provide = avoid like a plague.  


But chances are after a few exposure you can smell which investment scheme is a scam. The pattern is always the same. || I also want to add, there's a lot of tech related item scams on shopee

How to get unlimited voucher discount on Foodpanda,"**Late late update:**

This bug no longer works. Foodpanda team patched it on February.

If you still need to save on discounts, **just buy an Foodpanda account from shopee sellers.**

It costs around **RM 0.55 - RM 1.00** per account. When you got the account, just use **PANDABARU** promo to get discounts.

The promo code gives you a **40% off** on your order but with a **max cap of RM 10**.

Also! Remember to follow the instructions from the sellers. They usually wrote about it in the description section. 

Btw, you can see active promo codes and their details on the official Foodpanda website. 

[Link Here.](https://www.foodpanda.my/contents/deals)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

You must have came across numerous Foodpanda account listings on Shopee, Lazada and others.

Some sellers price their services high, but there're still some who sell at a low price.

**But why pay, when you can do it yourself?**

&#x200B;

**Note: I contacted the Foodpanda technical team long time ago regarding this \[Invite Friends\] bug. But they straight ignored my message and emails. Perhaps they have earned enough money already by** **~~scamming~~** **refunds?**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Basically, this bug is like inviting yourself to the system. Getting both welcome and referral reward vouchers altogether.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**What kinds of vouchers will this net you?**

**You'll get two vouchers:**

* **First-order: RM 10 discount off ( Min. spend RM 20 excl. delivery and service fees )**
* **Second-order: RM 10 discount off ( same requirement as the first voucher )**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Steps on how to get infinite discount:**

1. **If you have registered a Foodpanda account previously with your phone number written. You must log in to the account and change the phone number.**
   1. Just change it to random phone number like 016-999-999
2. Create a new account on Foodpanda
3. After you have reached the page where it asks for your phone number. Just click  ❌ on the top-right of your screen.
4. Then the account will be successfully created without a phone number.
5. Now. Click \[ Invite Friends \] from the options panel.
6. Tap your referral link once to copy the link automatically.
7. Go to your phone's browser and paste the referral link.
8. **In this step, your browser should redirect you to the Foodpanda app automatically**
9. **Try other browsers if you have an issue with automatic redirection.**
10. After your browser redirected you to the Foodpanda app, you will see a page like **""XXX sent you RM 10 and blah blah blah""**
11. Just click **\[ Continue to get your discount \]**. Then walah, you got the discounts.
12. **Walah, just order food delivery or pickup yourself later.**
13. You'll be asked for phone number before finally placing the order. Just type in your phone number and key-in the received OTP.
14. Always double-check your delivery detail and payment method is correct before placing the order.
15. Also, please make sure you have applied the discount voucher xD
16. Ya hoo! After successful payment, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for your foods!
17. **You're all done, please make sure to read the \[ IMPORTANT \] tab below.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ IMPORTANT \]**

* **Currently, this bug will only work on Android phones because Foodpanda referral links have problem redirecting-from-URL-to-app on Apple devices.**
* **ALWAYS check and make sure your delivery details/payment method selected is correct before placing order.**
   * **Because Foodpanda will not refund your order if:**
      * **You canceled the order even after you have waited for a long time**
      * **Riders can give excuses to Foodpanda HQ which will make your order be canceled.**
      * *Hence, you won't have any refunds nor will have your foods delivered.*
      * **Always best to use the Cash-on-delivery payment method. \[YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\]**
* **RULE OF THUMB: ONLY ONE PHONE NUMBER ON A FOODPANDA ACCOUNT**
* **After you have used up both of the discount vouchers, you must go to the \[ My Profile \] and change your phone number into random number.**
   * Just write the phone number randomly
   * Otherwise, you won't be able to use the same phone number again
   * **In a worst-case scenario, you'll have to contact Foodpanda to remove the phone number from your account if you accidentally forget the login credentials.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Update # 1 \]**

* **This bug still works on Android phones. Tested 8/8/2020 3:54 PM**
* **The voucher expiry date is 1 month from the claim date.**

\----------------------------------------------------------

**\[ Bug no longer works \] | They patched it on Feb**

* **See more details on the top of this post.**","Your ""Please don't scam your local businesses!"" warning post sure sounds like an instruction manual.

I don't encourage anyone to abuse this bug. 

The reason I post this information to the Reddit is that I want it to become viral so that Foodpanda will finally take action to fix and stop this bug.

I have already contacted Foodpanda before, but I guess no one will take note of anything coming from the mouth of a beginner programmer.

My voice is literally too little, that's why I need everyone's help to make Foodpanda fix the bug.

A lot of Shopee sellers already earned RM 1000 or even more from selling accounts with this bug. 

I cannot just sit there and do nothing. That's why I decided to post on the Malaysia subreddit.

Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in KL?,"[SOLVED ]

Anyone know of any Deep Dish Pizza shops or restaurants?

Quick Google search shows Pizza Express in Petaling Jaya, but their reviews seems to suggest the quality isn't the best.

Anyone have any experience there?
They have a GrabFoods page
Check out Pizza Express - Kelana Parklane Business Hub on GrabFood! https://r.grab.com/g/6-20240915_202218_8cab872680ed848c_MEXMPS-1-CYVZVBNFNUKKLX

If anyone knows if any supermarket sells frozen deep dish pizza, that would be suitable as well.

SOLVED Edit: Mean Mince still offers Deep Dish Pizza but it's only available for dine in or takeaway, delivery has to be self-arranged, so that explains why you won't see deep dish pizza on their GrabFood or FoodPanda.

The price for one is RM 83 and there is 3 toppings to choose from:

Spicy beef sausage mince 
Mushrooms 
Spicy chicken sausage mince","Mean Mince in PJ does deep dish pizza to my knowledge, not sure if the menu's changed || Was about to come here and say Mean Mince too.

Sarawak Food Pt2 - Aunty Xtina vs Slurrp,"So to recap: in my last post, we tested Sarawak Laksa & Kolo Mee from Mama Ting, and compared it to Slurrp. 

Slurrp won and I asked for more recommendations. 

One of the recommendations was Aunty Christina in Seapark. 

Today, we ordered Sarawak Laksa (the special at RM18.50 Grab price) and Tomato noodles. 

The verdict: 
Sarawak laksa - Slurrp still wins but of it was closed, I'd get from Aunty Christina, so it's a not-so-close second. Somehow, the flavour is still more intense at Slurrp. 

Tomato Mee - the partner says the sauce was thicker and more flavourful at Slurrp. 

So, to conclude: Slurrp is No 1, followed by Aunty Tina. 

Which Sarawak food joint shall I try next? ","Aunty Christina laksa best taken early when they are just opening. The broth is thicker then as it is being adjusted for taste. The kolo mee is tasteless. Tomato mee kinda forgettable.

I'm partial to the food at Rustic Borneo Kelana Jaya. They've the usuals i.e. kolo mee, kiau, fried kolo mee, laksa & tomato mee. They also have manicai bihun, Green Road style char kuay teow among others. Parking is horrendous though especially on weekdays. || Dang the price is 💸💸

I love laksa sarawak. Will definitely try there. But Mama ting kolo mee is damn good. || Lin Li Xiang is nearby... There's also Salted in mutiara damansara. || Rustic Borneo is on my ""to try"" list, it's just the timing - they close by 3pm and their location is kinda crappy traffic- and parking-wise. || Go foe Slurrp in SS2, I think it's definitely more value for money and tastier. Also, they open in the evening and parking is not so painful. || Dunno how many instances got people reporting got dead baby cockroaches and rotten eggs, liver and tofu in their noods. I kena once, my friend kena once. Never again. But overall better than Slurrp is now I guess, cause Slurrp jatuh standard mcm cause change owner? Or I see different people operating dah. || Another spot you can try would be 7th Mile Kitchen @ 5th Mile Cheras. It was the previous tenant of the shoplot where Rustic Borneo is at rn. Noodles are pretty good & that spot has the usuals as well. Laksa there just a bit off for me personally though many said it's good.

For halal fare, try Salted in Mutiara Damansara. The kolo mee is so simple yet so good with the Flavors from the fried shallots & shallot oil. The laksa a bit thicker with a slight curry-ish flavor to it but still yummy. || which kedai yang kena the cockroaches? LLX or Salted? || I’d vouch for 7th Mile Kitchen! But whoever is planning to go there just take note that they charge RM1 for the plastic bowl.

Looking for food recommendation in Kuantan,"I'm from Thailand and currently in Kuantan for Malaysia Coffee Week. This is my first time in Kuantan. I’m staying around East Coast Mall and Skytree Hotel, and I would like to get food recommendation nearby ideally within walking distance. If it's not walking but Grab reachable, I'm okay also.

I'm good with anything, Malay, Chinese, Indian. Any popular dishes or good places? Preferably dinner place for the evening.

Thank you so much in advance!","Welcome to my hometown! For food recommendations, you can try these:

1. Air Putih Cendol - You can order it on Grabfood, must-order if you have a sweet tooth
2. Mail Ikan Bakar - The touristy one is Ana Ikan Bakar Petai but my family prefers this one
3. Satay Zul - Best satay in town
4. Kam Loong Chicken Rice - best chicken rice and roast pork in town
5. Gerai Mok Naa - Delicious, freshly fried keropok lekor
6. Jaman Tory - Traditional Malay dishes like pekasam and ikan patin tempoyak is here, can order on Grabfood
7. Mek La - Kelantanese breakfast place selling laksam and nasi kerabu, this is a bit far and only accessible if you have transport
8. Hup Kee @ La Gourmet (in front of Public Bank) - Chinese yong tau foo with noodles and good coffee, can be a bit pricey but taste wise very consistent
9. On The Way Kopitiam - A new breakfast spot, this is a branch from Kuala Terengganu and features traditional dishes like laksa merah, a bit pricey and queue can be long
10. Pickers - A recent supper spot at Jalan Besar, serving local dishes and coffee, the decor is all about vintage items that Malaysians will definitely recognise

Have fun!

Edit: spelling || It's been years since I last visited kuantan, so not sure if these places still hold up. 

There's a noodle shop at teluk cempedak, Hoi Yin. I liked the curry mee.

Kula Cakes had a loooooong q when I went there. The mango cheesecake was the most recced item. There's outdoor seating has cute murals.

Someone told me that the cake is also available at this restaurant called Lila Wadi. I went there years and years but I honestly don't remember the food, so idk if I'd rec it. || ehmm.. coffee event in kuantan. Interesting (While I love coffee but I'm kinda waiting for Big Bad Wolf sale later in few weeks.). It's at East Coast Mall which is a food mall and located in a food-ish district here so you won't starve. I'm still trying out around the area, (for the mall itself, I've tried Banana Bros, Sushi King, Dolly Dim Sum and Dubuyo... it's practically what you usually get in Klang Valley) there's Vietnamese and Syrian food around too. 

Personally, I recommend the local east coast specialties if you can find them. Patin Tempoyak with Rice. Nasi Minyak with Ayam Masak Merah. Nasi Kerabu. Nasi Dagang. Keropok Lekor.

"Cheap, High-Protein Take-Out Options (UM, KL)?","**\[TL;DR: International student at UM living in a dorm with no kitchen or fridge. Can’t cook or store food, and Grab is too expensive. Willing to spend up to RM60/day, aiming for 150g protein and at least 1,500–1,800 kcal daily. Any affordable meal suggestions in/around UM?\]**

Apologies if this is the wrong sub, didn't know where else to go.

I'm an international student at UM, living in my college's dorm. The rent is super cheap, so I’m probably not moving out anytime soon.

The problem is that there's no kitchen or fridge, so I can't cook or store food. That cuts down a lot of options. Grab is usually way too expensive, so I'm trying to find a better way to eat without breaking the bank.

I'm willing to spend up to RM60 per day on food and aiming for around 150g of protein daily. If I can get some veggies and fruits (I love fruits), that’d be a big plus.

If you want specifics, I'm about 6 feet tall and weigh close to 178 lbs at the moment. My caloric requirements are about 2,000–2,500 kcal per day. I want to hit at least 1,500–1,800 kcal on most days if 2,000–2,500 isn't attainable yet.

Any suggestions? I’d really appreciate any tips on affordable, high-protein meals around UM!",,2/4/2025,2,0,1743577353,malaysianfood,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianFood/comments/1jpikk3/cheap_highprotein_takeout_options_um_kl/
The Worst Ramly Burger Experience,"Traveling to KL from JB, I was hungry and decided to grab some food from the R&R at Hentian Sebelah Kampung Bemban. Initially, I wanted to buy corn, but the Ramly burger caught my attention. So decided to try it. It cost RM4, but it tasted terrible. i never had such a bad Ramly burger in my life. The meat was burnt, and I ended up with a sore throat that night after eating it 🫠

Foodpanda vs grab vs shopeefood,"Hi all, Im the one who always ordered food online to avoid people and i found that ordering online saves a lot of money using the voucher and i can also ordering in bulk and save it for dinner or tomorrows lunch. Ive subscribed to panda pro and grabunlimited before. Didnt renew last yr for grabunlimed since it doesnt seem to be worth if for the discount given. Renewed panda pro as it gave lots of discount but lately the voucher and discount keep on decreasing. So i dont think i will renew it once it expire. And now i saw grabunlimed have few interesting voucher. Should i subscribe it.

Something that I can take the meat off of (I'm not a big meat eater). In the past successful things have been Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches that I microwave, but goodness am I burnt out on those.

"[Text] what did I make, or basically make, here? Basically a soup/stew with pork, tomatoes, Spinach, and chicken broth","Last night I fried up some pork, used some balsamic vinegar to deglaze, added in some ""Italian style"" chunky tomatoes, and water with some knorr chicken broth powder. After boiling for an hour I added some Spinach and let it cook for like ten minutes.

Tldr: from that description, does it sound like a dish from somewhere around the world? Even if it's the exact thing but with chicken, or if there's more herbs and spices, etc. 

(Honestly, I have no idea what kind of pork, it was frozen and in ziploc bag from a food Pantry, and I went in late and forgot to grab the label to go with it, assuming there was one. But it almost seemed like a mix of sausage and bacon, or bacon before it becomes bacon, or something like that)

I did also add some sugar and fish sauce, sugar because I wanted it to be a touch sweet, and fish sauce because for whatever reason I have fish sauce but no salt. I would have used soy sauce, but I left my bottle at a friend's(I must have been crazy). Oh and I did add in some gochugaru for a little heat a minute or two before deglazing.

For those who get inspired by this, I probably could have left out the fish sauce, as it is on the salty side,  but it went perfect with bread, so I imagine adding noodles or serving with rice would be fantastic!

So, to me, coming from Midwest America, it honestly tastes like ""sloppy Joes"".

But what about other cultures? I imagine Italy would have some form of pork/tomato soup, without the fish sauce and sugar probably. I feel like if you let it thicken it might be comparable to an Indian curry.

"[Text] Canneles de Bordeaux, Copper Molds, and Crunch - A long-winded explanation of cannele baking","*(This is a re-post of a submission I put on another sub a few years back, slightly edited to adhere to this sub's policies. I asked one of the food mods if I could post it here, as text posts are in their infancy on this sub, and was given the green light.)*

**TL;DR: You can bake fantastic canneles without expensive copper molds or beeswax. The best option for those wishing to bake canneles on a budget is to use a carbon steel pan with floured baking spray.**

**FORWARD**

**The most important takeaway:** *I'm not claiming there's no impact of the copper molds and the beeswax mixture on the cannele, as I haven't gathered enough evidence to claim these results.* Too many variables, including different cannele recipes, different brands of copper molds, different brands of beeswax, different proportions of beeswax and butter, and combinations of all of the above are things I haven't had the time, energy, or caloric space to deal with. 

However! The important takeaway here is that *you shouldn't let the copper/wax stop you from baking canneles.* Having compared the cheapest of the lot (muffin/spray) to the priciest (copper/wax), THAT is a conclusion I'm prepared to draw. Even for something that's 80% as good as the real deal, I still contend that the budget canneles are worth making. Additionally, having compared my recipe's canneles baked in a carbon steel pan with baking spray to the copper/wax, I couldn't find a *significant* difference in color or crust. I contend that the carbon steel method is the best version for casual home bakers who'd like to semi-regularly bake canneles, in regards to price and ease of use.

**INTRODUCTION**
Canneles are one of my favorite French pastries. It's a relatively less well-known French pastry characterized by its crunchy, crispy exterior, and its gooey, custardy interior. Think ""Portable, Snack-sized Creme Brulee"", and you've got the right general idea. They're traditionally flavored with rum and vanilla. Without getting too deep into the history of the pastry, ""canele"" vs ""cannele"" (I fear the Brotherhood too much to go with a single ""n""), and alternative flavorings, there are two aspects of the cannele that have been frustrating me for some reason.

Traditional Canneles de Bordeaux are baked in copper molds coated in a mixture of butter - typically clarified, to prevent the milk solids from burning - and...beeswax. The mixture is often referred to as ""white oil"", but because of its composition, I've grown accustomed to calling it ""gheeswax"". (Sorry.) 

Buying canneles at a patisserie can be an absolute grab-bag between amazing and disappointing. They're generally expensive for what you get, ranging from $3.50-$5 each. And they're hit-or-miss for the crust, the entire raison d'être of the cannele! Cannele crusts lose their crunch after 6 hours or so; far faster if they're improperly stored. I've run into so many ""squishies"" that I've decided it's not worth it in the slightest, if I can just make them myself and get a perfect crust nearly every time.

Now, you can find dozens of YouTube tutorials on how to make canneles, and making the batter is incredibly simple! Really, it takes ten minutes to prepare a batch sized for twelve two-inch molds. And rum or vanilla beans aside, the ingredients are all cheap as dirt. Baking them is a bit trickier, but that's a story for another time. Unfortunately, there are two main impediments I see for most people making these at home.

**1. Copper Molds.** The copper molds are expensive. To a degree of ""$20-30 per MOLD"" for the traditional copper route of the high-end stuff. Matfer/Mauviel ain't cheap. Now, there are cheaper copper mold alternatives that seem to work just as well, but even so, $30 for four molds isn't exactly appealing to a casual baker. Canneles take a long time to bake, and imagine being asked to make a dozen for a gathering when you only have four molds! ""Sure, just give me 4-5 hours.""

**2. The beeswax.** While it's not as expensive as the molds, it's still pricey enough that you wouldn't wanna shell out some cash for an ingredient that you'll only use for a single thing. Additionally, the beeswax/butter mixture is MESSY. To an incredible degree. Upon contact with surfaces at room temp, gheeswax will solidify within seconds, creating a greasy, waxy coating. that defies your attempts to clean it with an iron will. It'll stick to your countertop. It'll stick to your bench scraper as you scoop it up from the counter. It'll stick to your hands as you try and clean the bench scraper. Additionally, the mixture is harder to implement properly in order to form perfectly uniform canneles. Canneles seem to have a tendency to stick to the molds or develop ""white butts"" from excessive coatings on the bottom of the molds.

What drove this project was my frustration at how much importance was placed on these two key features. ""The copper's conductivity is CRUCIAL to achieving that crisp, crackly exterior!"" ""You absolutely *need* the beeswax to fuse with the outside to create that trademark crust!""


The latter bugged me in particular. Chef John from Food Wishes is known for many things, from his cadence to his use of simple tools and techniques more geared towards home cooks. His is the only tutorial I've found that doesn't use the copper molds, likely as a method of making the recipe more accessible. But he still espouses the importance of the beeswax! 

**Here's the thing:** *I've known for quite some time that you can get fantastically crackly crusts with the use of floured baking spray brushed inside the copper molds.* It's a natural discovery, really; you get fed up with the beeswax's mess, and go looking for alternatives. A quick spray, a few strokes of a pastry brush, and you don't have to deal with the white oil hassle.

It frustrates me that so many people feel they can't make canneles, because they don't have expensive molds or single-use beeswax. It frustrates me when I see people who erroneously think ""what's the point of making them, if X FoodTuber claims the crust isn't great without beeswax?"", when they've never had a direct reference to draw this conclusion.

So I did some testing to find decent baking times with a variety of pans. I initially planned to conclusively test the effects of beeswax and copper molds on crust intensity and color. Unfortunately, after a week or two of preliminary testing, I was getting weighed down by all the variables I'd need to test for a satisfying conclusion. Well, that and eating too many canneles to qualify my results. I also wasn't confident that I could present my findings in full in a reasonably entertaining fashion, so this is my abbreviated version.

I bring to you my method for your baking enjoyment. Here's my guide to making canneles both without copper molds/beeswax.

**CANNELE RECIPE** 

**Ingredients**

500g whole milk

50g unsalted butter, cubed

50g egg yolks

200g sugar

125g pastry flour, preferably (see Note 1 at the end)

2-3g salt

~10-15g (1tbsp) vanilla extract, vanilla bean paste, or the seeds of one vanilla bean + the vanilla pod

50mL dark rum of choice

White Oil/""Gheeswax"" (If using)

100g clarified butter

40g beeswax pellets

**Directions**

For the white oil, melt the beeswax in the clarified butter. Reserve until needed.

For the canneles, combine salt, sugar, and egg yolks in a mixing bowl and mix until homogeneous. Add the flour, and mix until the mixture resembles rough sand (see Note 2). Heat the milk and butter in a saucepan until the butter has melted and the mixture registers 185F/85C. (If using a vanilla bean, steep the seeds and the pod in the milk for 20 minutes before removing the pod and adding the butter.)  Pour about 1/4 of the mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing rapidly with a spatula. Add the remaining mixture, whisking to incorporate. Once the resultant mixture is combined, add the vanilla and rum. Mix briefly. Place clingfilm in contact with the surface of the batter, and refrigerate for a minimum of 12 hours. 


Before filling the molds, briefly stir the batter to re-homogenize it, then strain the batter to remove any potential clumps. I use the batter straight from the fridge, I don't bring it to room temperature.

**To prepare the molds/pans:**

**If using beeswax:** bring the mixture to 250F/121C (Heating the mixture to this temperature ensures a thin coating; too thick, and your canneles may taste overly waxy on the surface.). Fill one cannele mold to the brim, and immediately pour the wax back into your container. Leave the mold upside down on a wire rack over a sheet of clingfilm to drain. Repeat with remaining molds.

**If using spray:** Spray interior with floured baking spray. Use a pastry brush to coat the insides.

**For both methods:** once coated, stick the pans/molds in the freezer for 15 minutes. This seems to have some effect on preventing the canneles from bursting out of their molds or developing rounded bottoms, and is a common method of troubleshooting both issues. (I think there's a degree of oven type impact on these variables, but that's a story for another time.)

**BAKING:** I'm going to start with the method, but I'll mention the theory of HOW to bake canneles below. Everyone's oven is different, and the more knowledge you obtain, the more power you have over the process.

**For copper molds or carbon-steel pan:**

Preheat oven to 500F/260C (ideally, with a pizza stone on the lower rack). Fill cannele molds or pan with suitable quantities of batter. For my 2-in copper molds and my carbon-steel pan, I use 65-75g each, but you can go as high as 85g. (See Note 3)

Gently rap the pan/mold on your countertop once or twice to dislodge any air bubbles. Bake the molds on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper - the pan you can just shove in the oven - in the middle rack for **15** minutes, then lower the temperature to 400F/204C for 35-45 minutes. Carefully unmold canneles on a wire rack above some plastic wrap, and allow them to cool for at least 30 minutes before consuming to allow for full crust development.

**For muffin pans or Nordic Ware Bundtlette Pans:**

Preheat oven to 450F/232C (ideally, with a pizza stone on the lower rack). Fill cannele molds or pan with suitable quantities of batter. For my muffin pan, I do 80g batter per cavity, and for the Anniversary/Classic buntlette pan, I do 150g (different shapes will create slight baking time variations; adjust accordingly). 

Gently rap the pan on your countertop once or twice to dislodge any air bubbles. Bake in the middle rack for **10** minutes, then lower the temperature to 400F/204C for 35-45 minutes. Carefully unmold canneles on a wire rack above some plastic wrap, and allow them to cool for at least 30 minutes before consuming to allow for full crust development.

**GENERAL BAKING METHOD** (May contain conjecture)

Now for the more general idea: canneles are a high liquid-to-flour batter. It's this degree of moisture that enables canneles to remain soft and squishy on the inside despite the exterior's intense caramelization. There's just enough flour to hold the structure of the cannele together. Some recipes use less flour than mine, and they end up with sparse, open crumbs, instead of even, tighter crumb structures. The way to generally bake canneles is to subject them to an initial high blast of heat for between ten to fifteen minutes, then dropping the temperature, and continuing to bake until the desired doneness is achieved. 

The initial blast of heat helps expedite the outer caramelization, which creates the cannele's overall shape as the batter in contact with the mold develops into the crust. The second lower temperature and longer baking time is meant to thoroughly cook the cannele's interior before the exterior begins to burn. (Think of it as searing a steak in a cast iron pan that you then finish in a lower-temp oven.) With canneles, it's a balancing act: getting the cannele to be fully baked while ensuring the crust develops sufficiently without overly caramelizing and burning. 

And here's a fun fact about canneles: the intensity and color of the crust is directly proportional to the time and temp you bake them at. This is a no-brainer, really, but still. I measured crust thicknesses in my original tests, and even visually, you could see how they become thicker as you increase the baking time. Same with color: the longer the bake, the darker the color. Golden canneles would have a light, crispy crust, whereas the darker mahogany canneles would have a CRONCH that would wake the dead.

That being said, there's *also* an inverse relationship between crust intensity and vanilla/rum flavor. Extended baking times decreases the moisture content of the canneles (I observed a steady decrease in cannele masses correlated with increased baking times), and much of the vanilla and rum notes are overtaken by the complex caramel notes from the crust. **This is why I give general time ranges for this recipe.** (In addition to oven discrepancies.) How long you should bake them is entirely up to you. If you prefer the vanilla/rum flavors to be highlighted, bake them shorter. If you'd like to Pierre Herme them and ""when it's black it's cooked"" your canneles, enjoy a crust that'll break a tooth. Entirely up to you!

Another thing to note, as it's directly related to baking time: I typically bake 4-6 canneles at a time, and my baking times given here tend to reflect that. If you're baking two dozen canneles (say, if you bought two carbon steel pans) at once, you'll find that the heat distribution will be less efficient, and you'll end up with underdone canneles after 45 minutes at 400F/204C. Luckily, armed with the previously mentioned knowledge, you can simply pop 'em back in and continue baking them until done. Just check on them every 5-10 minutes until they reach their desired doneness.

**REGARDING THE PANS USED**

Of the pans I tested, I would rank the carbon steel as the best, with the muffin pan as the lowest. Here's my justification: The carbon steel generates a crust equivalent to the copper molds. It also has the traditional fluted design, which is quite aesthetically appealing. Additionally, it's relatively cheap, at close to $30 for what's essentially 12 cannele molds. 

The Nordic Ware bundt pan comes in second place, mainly because it's got a pretty shape for its cavities. It's also quite conductive and generates a fantastic crust. However, these can be quite expensive, and the cannele portions for the cavities are slightly on the larger side. That said, check your local thrift store, I occasionally find Nordic Ware for $5 a pop at Goodwill. 

I don't really like the muffin pan, as it's a bit more difficult to properly manage a proper crust while thoroughly baking the cannele. The surface area/volume ratio is a little wonky for canneles, and I don't think it produces a good balance of texture. It produces aesthetically unappealing canneles, and my patisserie-addled brain can't tolerate that.

**What I recommend for your first time baking canneles:**

Especially if you've never even had a cannele, here's what I recommend: cut the recipe into 2/3, just to save on rum and vanilla. Bake them all in the same pan, but after 30 minutes, unmold them (for molds, just unmold a single one; it's harder to unmold individual canneles in the pans). Carefully pop all but one or two back into the pan, then continue to bake for 5 minutes more. Repeat, until all the canneles are baked. 

What this will achieve is twofold: one, it allows you to immediately realize if your oven runs hotter or colder than mine, and you can adjust accordingly. Two, you'll now have a range of canneles with varying crust and flavor intensities. Try 'em all, see which ones you like best, note the corresponding time, and save that information for the next time around.

Anyways, that's how to bake canneles both with and without copper molds and beeswax. This was a project I started back in...February(?), and kept getting sidetracked by other things, like croissants and marshmallows. Feels good to finally get it out there.

**Note 1:** I've done previous tests, and lower-protein flours work best to optimize the custardy-ness of the interior. AP and Bread Flour will create a chewier interior. I haven't tried cake flour yet, but I'm sure it would be gooier still.

**Note 2:** The recipe I adapted mine from had this as the procedure, and I've stuck with it. I've found that either this way or adding the flour after adding the milk/butter both generated some clumps. They get strained out either way, so I've found it doesn't make much of a difference.

**Note 3:** I've seen some people say to only fill them to like 1cm from the top, or give precise weights that helped prevent the canneles from popping out. I dunno about this, I've baked aesthetically perfect canneles anywhere from 60-85g in the molds. That includes up to the very brim. I suspect either their procedures vary, their recipes are significantly different, or it's got to do with the way their oven distributes heat.

Additional note: with all that being said, I would still recommend using copper and beeswax, if only for the tradition, the flex, and the slight floral note I perceived as a result of the beeswax. Patisserie is all about going above and beyond, after all.

Spaghetti with Maine Sea Urchins [homemade],"
Recipe:

Spaghetti 80-100g dry per person cooked 1-2 mins before “al dente” Use De Cecco #12 or if you’re feeling fancy, monograno spaghetti. Spaghettoni is also ok but harder to find.

10-12 sea urchins per 2 persons kept on ice.

Freshest Olive oil you can get to coat the bottom of the pan. Use enough that it will pool when tilted.

1 clove lightly crushed garlic per 2 persons 

1 Calabrian chili per 2 persons (any medium chili will do but it’s the oil that’s gold and these are easy to find in jars at supermarkets.

Fresh Basil, mint & parsley (few sprigs each in equal parts)  chopped fine

More parsley or mint chopped thin once to garnish


Ingredients:

There are three main ingredients that are critical. 

Pasta with enough starch to bind the sauce and not turn to mush.

The Sea Urchins (seasonal, might have to talk to some fish mongers but actually inexpensive in areas where they are found)

Don’t bother with packaged uni from the Asian market that is all dried out or frozen. It will be flavorless and kind of gross in texture. Getting a good sauce will be hard.

But many Asian markets do get live sea urchins seasonally if you don’t live in a part of the world where they can be had fresh.

The Olive oil (if you wouldn’t want to eat it plain with bread and no salt don’t use it). Fresher the better, the Greeks are best value for $ in real olive oil. Most of the oil at the supermarket is just canola oil with some near rancid olive oil mixed in.

If you have those three this will be amazing.

Prep:

Start prepping urchins 2 hours before dinner because you will be nervous like I was about stabbing myself. It’s actually not easy to do and chef’s apparently handle them all the time without gloves. I used 2 pair thick kitchen gloves. A kitchen towel for holding it is helpful too when piercing the shell with your knife.

If you do something ridiculous like sit or step on one (what happens in the ocean) and a spine goes deep in and breaks off you will be fine! It’s a bacterial infection that is the issue if not treated not poison as some people think. It won’t be fun but you’ll live.

Go seek medical attention of course but you should do that if you slice open your finger around any meat or poultry for the same reason. 

I have zero fear about doing this now and I was extremely nervous at first.

Use a really sharp small knife to start a hole in the top (they have a mouth on “top”).

Then use kitchen scissors to cut open a hole in the top. Don’t worry about the shell bits, you will be rinsing the urchin in cold cold water.

Carefully use the knife to cut away at the black bits to get to the yummy orange roe. If you have like a tiny tea spoon or such that’s perfect.

I put the roe on to a plate discarding the rest, you’ll still get some “juice” with the roe which is goodness. Use a white plate so if a spine or shell bit wants to take a ride you can easily fish it out from the roe. It’s tedious but not difficult, they contrast well. 
This is why the rest are keeping cold on ice.

Put the clean roe in a container back on ice as you work.

When done put the roe in the fridge covered for at least 30 mins.(do not freeze)

I mixed all of mine at the end for extra thick and creamy sauce but if you are a purist pick out some of the biggest best looking pieces to garnish at the end.

It won’t look like you have much but trust me you do. This stuff has far more umami when fresh.

Cook:

Bring water to boil add decent amount of salt (never oil). Do not go crazy with water / pasta ratio. We want some starchy goodness. Do not add pasta.

In a relatively thin pan (cheap aluminum is actually best) heat oil slowly if needed until it shimmers but does not smoke.

Crush garlic enough to remove skin and add to pan, do not slice dice or chop. We want essence of garlic oil, if you like more add an extra clove but also lightly crushed. Too much garlic isn’t the best for this dish.

Add chili whole, a little chili oil if you like it spicy-ish (this is not a spicy dish)

Let them fry gently tilting the pan at times to fully submerge the garlic cloves and chili. You are making infused oil. If it smokes start over. When garlic starts to lightly brown all over and chili is blistered turn off heat and set aside.

I chop up my fine herbs at this point and add half to still very warm oil (you are infusing not cooking) no cook the oil! No! I know you want to. Do not lol.

We are cooking pasta and nothing else!

You have fresh chopped herbs for the end.

Never add cheese, never add cream/milk/vodka whatever lol. It will ruin the texture of the sauce.

Remember we didn’t add pasta? Yeah for good reason, you burnt the oil at least one time because you’re like me. Are your victims, guests I mean guests ready to eat?

This is severed fresh. Hopefully you’re all snacking on things and this is the main event so it should be served within seconds (not minutes of plating).

All that work you just did? No extra left over, nothing chilling in the fridge for tomorrow.

If you have a serving plate warmer then do that now(fancy pants). Or throw plates in oven and set to min setting (200F / 100C) turn heat off when the oven beeps.


Drop the pasta into a rolling boil. Set the timer to the box instructions (minus 2 minutes) once pasta is completely submerged.

Use the directions on the box for Al dente. they are correct, you aren’t smarter than a food scientist at a pasta company that does molecular analysis of pasta as part of their product development and QA. It took me a long time to admit the above to myself. I’m that guy, stop being me!

That infused oil is all cold though… I want to heat it up… no!!!! Leave it.

Ok but take out the garlic and chili, toss them.

Timer is going off, grab the pasta and toss it directly into the pan with the infused oil, put it on high heat. Ladle in just enough of that salty starchy pasta water to kind of cover half the pasta. Maybe 1-1.5 ladle per 2 servings.

Set timer 2 minutes.

It will start to boil fast and froth, keep stirring to keep it from burning, if it starts to get dry add a little water and or reduce heat but that froth is more starchy starch!

2 mins up. Remove from heat.

Grate fresh pepper, don’t go crazy.

Add urchins immediately right from the fridge and mix in well, the sauce will get a little too thick. 

If it’s too soupy return to low heat and keep stirring until it does that spoon thing.


Taste the sauce:

is it salted right? Add drinking water and a little fresh oil not pasta water in small amounts to loosen up the sauce.

Think it needs more salt? Pasta water and oil, you get it. 

The clean spoon test is good but you’ll see it when it’s right it looks like you’re a liar and added cream.

Stir in the rest of the finely chopped herbs and plate on those very warm plates.

Spatula any remaining sauce from the pan to pour over at the end.

Garnish with a few of those pretty pieces of roe if you reserved some, add that last bit of sauce and sprinkle with freshly thinly chopped herb mix for color. I like to just garnish with the mint.

More fresh Pepper and or lemon (sorrento lemons if you can find them) are optional.

I think a really bright lemony, is Lemony a word? Lemony wine or light beer (worst case a Peroni) should be considered.

Fiano’s can be yummy, some Trebbiano blends.

Any Sicilian white blend “tre siciliano”.

Dry Malvasea too. 

Whites from Latzio.

Red wine and fish is expert mode. This was already enough work.

"""So, what's for dinner, honey?"" Response: ""Roadkill."" ""What?"" I said. ""Yup, roadkill!"" And it was!","It had been a so-so day at work and I was on my way home. I popped in through the front door, tossed my stuff onto the ""Stuff Here"" chair (notably in disagreement with my then wife's feeling about the chair's use: for sitting!), and cheerfully asked, ""So, honey, what's for dinner?"" The response was, as noted in the thread title, ""Roadkill,"" and...she was serious!

""What?""

""Yup, roadkill.""

Okay, this is my first time living in Minnesota, a state I was quickly coming to love, and my then wife, being a farmer's daughter, was never without frequent surprises: how she thought, how she ate, and a whole host of other ""how she"" things that I had come to enjoy. As to her, food meant meat and potatoes (hey, she's a mid-west woman who understands the taste value of meat and starch. I'm in. It's all good.)

I said, ""What do you mean, roadkill?"" figuring she was somehow (I was sure hoping) messing with me. But I knew that look on her face; the absence of any look, signifying only 'I said what I meant'.

She then went on, with a smile developing and a happy demeanor following, telling the story of how she was driving down one of our local country roads, and BAM!, the truck in front of her smacked a pheasant, but ah, only on the head, which (to the relief, I'm sure, of the hit-and-run driver) was all it took to take the bird out, the rest of the bird being undamaged. (Hey, if you've never seen what a low-flying pheasant can do to a windshield, learning the hard way is like discovering first hand what a nuke does to a city!)

""So,"" she continued, ""I figured, why not grab it and take it home for dinner!"" I blinked...blinked again, my brain pretty much at a loss for any chance to work this through—hey, it's free (okay, I get that), it's dinner (always good to fill the tank), and it's...my first time eating roadkill, something I figured would have to happen sooner or later in life, clearly sooner, much sooner than I had anticipated.

“Oh...okay.” Her kids were all excited, which only caused me to question more my sanity, their sanity, and why I moved to this state in the first place. But Minnesota was growing on me, and not in the way things were growing on me, and others, in the Bay Area, Cal., where I'm from (I'm kidding, okay!). I'd have to give her the benefit of the doubt. But the one question going through my mind (after it worked out the “Run, you idiot!”) was...what other roadkill has she found palatable? I mean, I had seen Snapping turtles on the highways, which, not being nearly as fast as the required speed limit, are often doomed to the world beyond, leaving little to be desired, much less as roadkill. Had she managed to save some undefined part of of one of these turtle's accident-leftovers and make soup or something? For pete's sake, it was just days before that a neighbor brought over squirrel soup. (I never thought to ask the roadkill question...once again, my brain was trying to figure out how the hek our neighbor could even catch one squirrel much less enough to make soup.)  

Well, to make a long story less exasperating, we ate the pheasant (not without first cooking it, for which I was very thankful, amidst my brain's cessation of its regularly broadcasting programming), and...I was...well, it wasn't bad. Not bad at all. “No, honey, please do *not* save the head for stock,” I implored my wife. “That just won't work! Trust me. I know food! Pheasant head doesn't make good stock!” (Well, it might, but not when plucked off the road having lost a battle with a Ford pickup. Either way, I didn't want to find out.)

And so, my first roadkill. Probably my last, unless the economy continues on the decline; at which point, sooner or later, it will probably be roadkill leftover McDonald’s or Wendy's, since there's no pheasant's around my parts!","I would be all for eating the pheasant as long as someone else cleaned it!  || There was a guy featured on the show Taboo who actually went out of his way to find roadkill to eat.

Italian Lamb Pasta (5.90 pp)," Time and time again I get asked the questions:
""How can you be bothered cooking all the time?
Is it even worth it?"" 

This is my answer.
This Italian favourite is simple and delicious!

Let's do a quick evaluation of cost.

INGREDIENTS - Serves 4

Olive Oil - 2 splashes $0.10

Lamb Forequarter Chops ~1kg $8.50   

Garlic 3-5 cloves - $0.50

Thyme 20-40gm - $2.50

Brown Onions x2 - $0.30

Carrot x2 - $0.50

Parsnip x1 -$1.00 (optional but preferred)

Whole tinned tomatoes 300-400g x2 - $2

Tomato paste ~ 140g - $1

Pasta for 4 $1

Red wine 150ml ~ $1.50 (Drink the rest!)

Salt and pepper to taste. 

White sugar - 1tsp

Butter - 1 knob 


(Optional but preferred ingredients) 
Red wine $? ($5) - I usually drink it whilst cooking this and with the food!

Gremolata. 
Garlic x1 is purely optional. 
Bunch of Flat leaf parsley - $1.50
Lemon zest - $0.50

Total cost = $23.60 /4
= $5.90AU pp. 

METHOD
Prepare the onion and garlic by removing the skins and dicing.
Start off by using a thick bottomed crock pot, pouring a splash of olive oil and setting the cooktop to low. 

When the oil starts to run easily, place the garlic and onion into the pot, and simmer softly until it becomes translucent in colour.
Whilst the onion and garlic is simmering, roughly de-stalk the thyme, by pulling the leaves off directly into the pot, stirring every now and then to make sure it doesn't burn.
Chop the carrot and parsnip into bite size chunks and place into the pot.

Whilst the vegetables and simmering softly, grind the salt and pepper in a mortar and pestle and heavily season the lamb on both sides.
Grab a frypan, set the cooktop to medium heat, and put the second splash of olive oil in the pan. 
Place the meat into the pan, and brown slightly, until the meat just starts to caramelise on both sides.
(If your frypan is too small, this can be done in two batches.)

While you brown the meat, 
Pour both tins of tomatoes and the tomato paste into the vegetables. 
Add a teaspoon of sugar to cut acidity.

When the meat is lightly browned, 
Place into the vegetables and combine, then take the frypan with caramelisation off the heat to cool and drain the oil. 
When the frypan has cooled slightly, 
Add the red wine and deglaze the pan on low heat, until the caramelisation is near gone. 
Pour into the pot and combine. 

Let the pot simmer for approximately two hours, or until the parsnip has gone soft and golden in colour. 
Stir every half hour to ensure even cooking. 

After the meat is cooked, remove from the heat to cool off.
Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling water and strain placing the pasta back into the empty pot. Drop a knob of butter into the pasta for gloss and stir. 

Chop the parsley and lemon to garnish.

What are some good meals for someone of very very humble paychecks?,"I'm looking for some good food ideas for a reasonably small amount of money. I'm not super poor as to eat Ramen but if I buy ingredients I want them to be able to be used for more meals. 

I ended up looking this up on Google and most of the guides were like

""All you need is these 5 ingredients. Now fire up your brick oven and grab the paprika off your spice rack and lets get started.""

""Alright now put this in your food processor""

Stuff like that.

So I'm looking for recipes I can make woth pretty much a sink and oven. No microwave, no grill, fridge space is limited and meals gotta be at least like less than 8 bucks per meal otherwise I might as well hit taco bell and cry myself to sleep. 

I don't care about gluten free or uh.. Dietary stuff. All those online guides are like EAT HEALTHY FOR 4 DOLLARS A MEAL

It's really a bunch of crappy snapchat photos but it turned out pretty good for having never made a pizza before.

Not too sure on quantity of ingredients.  It would've also been cheaper for me to just buy a pizza from Sam's Club.

I just grabbed shit I thought I would need I a few packets of some yeast that said it was for pizza. (quick 30 min)

Bought cheapest unbleached flour I could find in Walmart.

I just put one cup of water added like 3-4 spoons (not sure on measurement just average silverware sized spoons) of olive oil I already had sitting around. 

Started with a cup of flour added one more and it seemed like enough so roughly 2 cups of flour till it looked like pizza dough you see people tossing on the food network or random tv shows. 

I just folded it and punched the dough as if it killed my whole family for a few minutes. 

I used Ragu Spaghetti Sauce I already had laying around.  

Bought some Great Value Mozz Cheese

6 Tyson Chicken Nuggets I microwaved for a minute to defrost them just so I could cut them up. 

Cut up a green pepper because i hear vegetables are good for you. 

Bought some hormel pepperoni.

The first one turned out okay so I just did a repeat except ran out of nuggets so put some Star Kist chipotle Tuna in the 2nd one.

I just preheat the oven to 400 degrees and tossed them both in pans I already had.  Initially was going to make traditional circle pizzas but I didn't own pizza pans so.... yeah 

I didn't have any type of a timer but seemed like they were done after 20 minutes at 400 degrees.

This isn't anything fancy and the recipe is absolute shit but just thought I'd share my first experience making a pizza.

It turned out tasting way better than I thought and looking way better than I would've ever expected for that matter. 

Maybe next time I attempt this again I'll try to actually measure the ingredients.

Taco Party Perfection,"Unfortunately as the original creator of this particular recipe, I am unable to find any pictures of the recommended recipe, however a description, you will find, is plentifully sufficient for self creation of this wonder of adult entertainment refreshment and refillment.


Step One!

Gather Pico ingredients:

        Onions (vidalia preferred, then red, then brown, then white)

        Cilantro (a must)

        Chiles (no habs, no ghost peppers, you crazy people, but the wider the variety of flavorful peppers the better your enjoyment, I assure you {think negro, pasilla, anahiem, chipotle, and all the other wonderful flavor chiles out there}.)

        fresh garden tomatoes (if you cannot pick them from the vine, then leave them out.)

        The cheapest vodka or clear tequila you can find, trust me you actually want to go for the least expensive brand out there and I will explain why.



Now here is some simple assembly;

        Rip apart the ingredients and place in a glass

        Make sure the total volume of the glass is no more than half full after adding the ingredients.

        Add the alcohol, at least enough to fully submerge the ingredients.

        Wait 3-5 minutes while you grab some other refreshments or catch up on the game.

        Top off with ice and enjoy




Now you see, the main crucial difference between expensive and inexpensive liquor is something called essential oils.  Every food in existence is made partially of essential oils, just like when you sweat your skin has oils that leak out, so does every edible flower(i.e. all veggies and fruits) in existence.  By adding your own garden fresh pico, you are essentially replacing the non-existent essential oils of cheap liquor with that of the produce included in the mixed drink.  Thus immitating and possibly improving upon the quality of top shelf liquor.  Additionally, once you have finished your drink, the pico in your drink is automatically 'quick-pickled' and can be put on top of your next taco to perfectly season your meal.  Pico should be refreshed every other drink.  Enjoy responsibly, and happy partying.",,8/10/2015,3,0,1444262478,food,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/3nwov4/taco_party_perfection/
Mabuyu (baobab seeds) as a sweet snack [VIDEO],"Baobab seeds are usually white in colour and they have a sweetish, chalky taste.

Office Lunch suggestions,"Hello Reddit,

I have horrible lunch habits and need your help solving this issue.  I work in an office and more often that not we go out to grab food for lunch instead of me bringing a lunch to work.  I am finding this to be very expensive and I am sure it is not very good for me.  I am wondering if anybody has any good recipes or guides for office lunches.  We have a microwave and a fridge in the office.

You help is appreciated.

Thank you.","Go to your local store and buy some mason jars. When you get home you should fill then with things you like to eat but are semi-healthy (if that's what you're looking for).

Rice and chicken.
Baked beans and sausage.
Mashed potatoes with veggies mixed in.
Soups or stews.

Yaknow, things like that. They're easy to carry and can usually carry a decent size of food in them (if you buy a large jar like 12-16oz). They can be microwaved too, provided you take off the lid. || I usually try to make enough dinner for 2 meals, box up the leftovers and take them with me the next day.

When that fails I grab fruit, bread, cheese and ham on the way to work, I make a quick sandwich there and have an apple or orange on the side. || Mason jars...Great idea.
I'm sick of having pyrex stolen, and am sick of washing my tupperwares by hand.  || Do you have a red and yellow stripped airtight box under your work desk that is labeled ""EMERGENCY HAM"" that holds everything to make a sandwich?

You should. || They can be cheap to, mason jars.

Amazon sells them at discount prices all the time, but then again, what don't they sell at a discount?

I started bringing mason jars to work about a year ago, and it's really great. I usually bring one big one, but at times I'll bring two; each with their own foods in them. 

Just make sure you keep them in your backpack/whatever so people don't take them.. though I doubt you'd be losing much money if someone took one. I also recommend either making the food at night time so it's cooled in the jar all night; or to bring a hand-towel wrapped around the jar (and secured with a rubberband or something) if you make hot food in the morning.  || Yeah, perfect. I don't know why I haven't though of this, honestly. I use them for various air-tight storage things around my house, and thought I was being handy by using them for non-food stuffs. Apparently, I missed the big picture, and looked right over the mason jar's actual intended purpose of storing food.

The best potatoes you'll ever have... Probably...,"Ingredients for the best potatoes you've ever had... maybe... but probably.

* 5lb bag of Red Russet potatoes
* 2 large white, yellow, vidalia onions (size of a softball)
* Head of garlic (You'll want 8-10 cloves, peeled and washed)
* Olive Oil
* Large grain kosher salt
* Fresh pepper

Equipment Needed

* Sharp Knife (I prefer my 8"" or 12"" wide chef's knife. Make sure it's sharp. A dull knife is a dangerous knife)
* Food processor if you have it, If not no worries
* A large bowl. Base size off of how much you will be preparing. If I need to prep a lot, I'll do it in 2-3 smaller batches. 
* Grilling Pam
* Heavy duty aluminum foil. (I prefer the larger size roll)
* Gas grill is preferable, If not an oven will do.

Buy 5lb bag of Red Russet potatoes. Take as many or as few as you'd like. Scale appropriately. This recipe is for 1/2(ish) of the bag.

Chop into Homefry size chunks (chop small/med potato in half, lay halves flat, chop into 3rds, then rotate 90^o and chop 3-4 more times)

put into bowl

take 2 whole (good size, like a softball) white, spanish yellow, or vidalia onions and chop finely. (Pro tip. Chop ends off, slice outside layer off with a thin cut. Cut in half from top to bottom. Lay both sides on the flat half and cut narrowly spaced cuts from ***ALMOST*** the top (this will keep it together for you to cut it), all the way through the bottom going left to right. Then rotate 90^o and chop 1/4"" at a time so you get nice even chunks of onion!)

Put onion into the same bowl as potatoes. Add a pretty heavy drizzle over the bowl. Mix around until everything is evenly coated. You can't really put too much on, but don't drown the spuds. It's not nice. 

Prepare your garlic by either dicing it in the food processor until there are no large pieces, but don't over do it, You don't want garlic paste, You want nice small chunks. If you don't have a food processor just chop it up fine with your knife.

Evenly distribute the garlic into the bowl and mix (with your hand or whatever you wanna do...)

Add a few pinches of salt to the bowl, and a pretty hefty amount of black pepper. Again, mix these into the bowl until everything is evenly coated.

**The Food Prep Is Done!!**

***Preheat grill 

Lay your aluminum foil out so it is about 1.5x as long as the width of the foil sheet (If you're using a small roll). If you're using a large roll, just reverse the dimensions. a 2 foot wide roll means that you're looking for anything around 1.5' long. Cut a second piece that is the same size and put ontop of the other sheet. Spray liberally with Pam until everything but 2"" from the edges is covered completely. 

Pour some of your potato mixture from the bowl, but not too much. It's easy to go overboard and the proportions will take practice. You're going to be making airtight pouches out of the foil. Take the long sides of the foil and have them meet like you're folding a towel (or whatever). Fold the seam over twice, taking about 1/4"" of foil each time. Make sure this is airtight-ish. Fold one end over, now stand the foil tube on end while making sure no seams pop open. Once the potatoes are packed into the sealed end, seal the open end. 

Flip the pouch over so the seam is down ontop of the other piece of foil and repeat ^. Make sure the pouch is as airtight as you can make it. You don't want the precious juices of what you're cooking getting out. 

Once you have packed all of your pouches ( usually 3-4) take them outside and put them on the grill. The grill should be on med-low heat, and make sure they are evenly spaced so they get cooked at the same temperatures. 

Flip every 10-15 mins (You don't want them sizzling too much. If they are very loudly sizzling, turn the heat down a tiny bit)

These will be on (depending on the temp) for 45-60 minutes. 

Once cooking is complete, take the pouches off of the grill and put them on the side tray, or a table, or whatever you have that won't be effected by the heat. Let them sit for a good 10 minutes under a folded dish towel (to keep the heat in, and to finish off cooking).

Grab a bowl that is large enough to hold all of the potatoes you've cooked. Open the foil pouches carefully (I prefer opening one end and letting it cool, then going after the other end with a pair of tongs while I hold the cool end in my hand)

Pour into a bowl and you should have carmelized onions and golden roasted potatoes!!! They're delicious. 

**For leftovers**

If there are any... Just pack them up in the fridge until the next morning. Cook some bacon and render the fat. put some of the fat in a pan and pour the leftover potatoes into it. Cook them until they are crispy golden brown on the outside. Cook some sunny side up eggs (because yolk is the fucking bomb on these things), and make some damn toast and butter the shit out of it. Because butter.

Enjoy!!!

"Why You need to Make Your kids eat salad, aka, My Greatest Fast-Food Experience.","I was just retelling this story to a friend who thought r/food might also find it funny so here I am!

My boyfriend and I were on a road-trip from Chicago to San Francisco, and had stopped around Kanab, Utah for the night.  It was late, we were exhausted and hungry.  Of course the only place left open in town was a McDonalds, so to the drive-thru we went.  And there we sat for about 5 minutes, no one ever came onto the intercom.  We figured since it was so late the McDonalds had a small crew and they probably didn't notice the drive-in had a customer so we drove up.  There was only one drive-in window, and through it we could see there were two young men on staff, one short and skinny, and one was quite tall, overweight, and sweaty (we could see how much he was sweating through the window, it was insane).  They were both standing, staring off into the distance right in our direction, but made no move to answer the drive-thru window.  We knew the place was still open, so my boyfriend rolled down the window and began knocking on theirs  The skinny one snaps out of his trance and walks over to the window very wobbly, as if he was drunk.  He finally makes it to the window and decided to pry it open with his hands instead of using the button.  He greeted us with a resounding ""huh?"" and fell silent. 

My boyfriend is super patient, he calmly asked him to confirm the store was still open, because we would like to place an order.  He proceeds to look at his wrist which has no watch on it, nods to confirm that they were open, and then walks away leaving the window open.  My boyfriend called back to him again that we wanted to place an order, and he then very wobbly made his way back to stare silently at us again.  Now the large one in the background had been staring at us the whole time this was happening and had not moved from his original spot.  He made his way over to stare at us unblinking, over the shoulder of his shorter friend.  My boyfriend said he would like a 10 nugget meal with a coke, and that I would like the southwestern salad. 

The skinny one took a minute to process this and then responded ""oh yeah man, nothing's ready, man so you're going to have to wait.""  And wait we did.  Skinny went off to attempt to make our meal while the large one never moved from his spot at the window, continuing to stare like a zombie at us, sweating profusely.  My boyfriend tried to hand him his credit card twice and he had no reaction at all!  

Fifteen minutes later we have the chicken nuggets, and our drinks.  Skinny reappears and maneuvers around his fat zombie friend to tell us in these exact words that he ""f*cked up the little potatoes"" and we would have to wait while he ""gave it another try.""  At this point it was obvious the dynamic duo was on something, only one of them seemed to be partially functioning.  Ten more minutes pass and we finally got some french fries that were fresh but overcooked, some were brown.  Whatever, we just wanted to get our last item, the salad and get to our hotel, we had been waiting a half an hour for freakin' McDonalds! 

My boyfriend reminded skinny of the salad and he fell silent and immobile again next to his friend.  My boyfriend repeated the salad order, using large explanatory hand gestures, and skinny meandered around his friend and was off again.  When he finally returned with the salad, it had no chicken in it.  We then had to explain that the salads had chicken included with them, and then waited another 5 minutes for him to return with chicken in the salad. 

OMG- we were so close- all they had to do was give us the salad dressing and we could get the hell out of there!  We asked him for salad dressing and his face contorted with confusion.  He told us we had our salad and were free to go.  We repeated yes we had the salad but needed salad dressing for it.  Skinny took a minute to think and then said ""like the ketchup or the big mac sauce?  You want that on the side?  I can't do that man.""  We shared a look of disbelief- this kid didn't know what SALAD DRESSING WAS.  I described what the packages of McDonalds salad dressing looked like with Paul Newman on the front, and Skinny was then off on his next mission of discovery.  He appeared again with a large box, and scooted around his zombie friend who I swear to god had not moved from staring at us the entire 35 minutes we were sitting there. 

""Ok,"" he said. Then he began to try to read off what kinds of dressings were in the box, horribly mispronouncing EVERY SINGLE ONE, his pronunciations are as follows in parentheses.  ""We have Ranch (ron-chee), Thousand Island (thou-za iz-lay), asian ( he didn't even try, he just called this Chinese), and...."" he began mouthing words and became even more confused.  ""We have... we also have..... balsa dressing.... no.... bala-stic.... noooo...... ohhhhh.... BALSMUK Dressing!""  He was trying to say Balsamic Vinaigrette, and smiled in the end, quite pleased that he had finally said it 'correctly.'  I told him I would love some BALSMUK dressing, and we grabbed it and got the hell out of there, with the two of them staring blankly out the window at us as we left.  It wasn't until we even got back to the hotel that we realized they never even charged us for the food!

Moral of the story?  I guess make sure your kids know what a salad is, and don't get high at work.  Though a pain in the ass at the time, this is my favorite fast food memory!

"[META] What happened to the ""Be nice to each other."" rule?","Hey,

My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub. 

I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.

I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this: 

>Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn.
Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.

and this (gross 15 upvotes)

>That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's ""Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise.""

These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?

If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.

If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.

Cheers.","My only hopeful thought is that a lot of the viciousness might have come from being on the front page.

Oh... || Have y'all seen sushi or paella threads? It's a fucking war zone. It blows my mind that people are such dicks about such petty things.  || I was reading the comments and even I was a little taken aback. I don't know what crawled up everyone's butts today, but there really was way too much hostility in there.

Chili has many different variations and people who pound the ""no beans"" drum need to remember that there is no official way of making correct/true chili unless you TOTALLY mess it up and just go crazy with random ingredients. I'd honestly love to see what kind of vitriol my chilis would get from those people, because I love to toss lots of lentils into mine. || I completely agree that a lot of the comments were unnecessarily vicious. But I think that a lot of people brought out the claws because they felt the title was misleading.  When they clicked on the link most people were expecting maybe a city or statewide caliber chili cookoff winner, when in actuality it was just OP and a couple of friends who held it amongst themselves.

"What vinaigrette did I have..., sharp, tart taste","I was travelling and found myself having to buy my own dinner everynight on the way home. I stopped at a health food store and grabbed their mixed salad and it had a vinegar, black liquid salad dressing I think was vinaigrette. It had a sharp taste that was tart. Kind of sweet. Very delicious. I tried a store bought vinaigrette, I think it's a Ken's Steakhouse type deal, basalmic? vinaigrette - doesn't taste the same at all. Which should I try to get the same tartness?","Definitely try making your own dressing. It's simple and doesn't need to be kept cold! Different brands of balsamic vinegar have different acidity levels, which are usually on the bottle somewhere. I personally like one that's not too acidic, but the sharpness of the vinegar may have contributed to the tartness you liked. Here's a simple recipe:

* Pour some balsamic vinegar into a tall jar, about 1/4 of the way full. Add almost twice as much olive oil. If it's too oily at the end, just add more vinegar.

* Add: a generous teaspoonful of mustard powder, a pinch of sugar or a dollop of honey, and salt and pepper to taste.

* Seasoning options (as many as you like): oregano, basil, thyme, celery seed, and fresh pressed garlic to taste. Beware; the garlic increases in potency after sitting overnight.

* Put the lid on tightly and shake shake shake until the dressing is emulsified.  || Sounds like they just tossed the salad in a basic aged balsalmic vinegar with some olive oil.

We're going to open a snack bar/restaurant and we need your help in creating the menu,"I hope this is the correct subreddit to post to. We're going to open a small business in around 10-15 days from now and we're writing down the menu. We have a few basic ideas, but we need your help in expanding them. Unlike traditional restaurants (where I live), we don't want ours to be grill-based. Matter of fact, we won't offer grilled food. 

We want to make a breakfast-based restaurand by making breakfast homemade again, because in our town, the only restaurants open for breakfast time are fast food restaurants.

Note: Breakfast-based doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on other parts of the day.





Tl;dr: We need menu ideas, especially for the breakfast part and menu lists of other restaurants you know/like.





Edit: Per request, here's our current menu

**Breakfasts**

-Mekici and Macedonian cheese (Mekici literally translates to 'softies'. It's basically fried dough)

-Fried eggs, goat cheese and Ajvar

-Taco-like bread with Pavlaka and fresh peppers

-Eggs, sausages and tomatoes

-Ajvar, cheese and a homemade loaf of bread

-Homemade plum jam & bread (goes extremely well with a side of cold milk) 

(most of the breakfasts are hard to translate)

**Sandwiches**

-Club sandwich

-French (basically a BLT in a rounded loaf (I know that's not a french sandwich, but that's what my country calls it)

-Half-pounder(we live in a metric country and we call it the half-kilo-er(weighs 300g but it's still rather big))(contains a whole lot of fried ham, 
cheese, and some green salad, all of it inserted into a big homemade loaf)

-Fried cheese

-Chicken Roll (basically a chicken burrito)

**Pizzas**
10 basic types of pizza that all of the pizza restaurants around offer (your basic Margherita/Capriciossa etc.)

**Snacks**

Our culture allows people to go out at night, grab a beer and order snacks to eat. Finger food, basically)

-Chicken fingers

-Fried onion rolls

-Homemade chips

-Fries covered in cheese




**Main**

Most of our main dishes are served in a clay pan

-Mac'cheese'bacon' served in a clay pan 

-Chicken in curd





This is our menu, with the exclusion of about 6 articles whose names I am unable to translate.

I understand it is small, that's why I posted asking you to help us either expand it or tell us why to keep it the way it is.

Note: We live in a country with a very different culture to the one you live in, so this menu may seem obscure to you but is well-accepted in my country.

"When ordering food from any type of restaurant, what purchases do you tend to avoid and why?","For me, I tend to avoid any type of ""simple"" pasta dish at an Italian restaurant such as spaghetti. I know pasta is super cheap and easy to prepare and couldn't fathom spending $15 on a plate of it.

Also when ordering from any fast food place (if i plan on going home) i never order drinks because they cost almost as much as the food and I can just grab something outta the fridge when I get home.","I avoid anything I can make almost as well or better at home.

I prefer to pay for ethnic food I can't or don't often make, seafood (as long as it's from a decent place) or anything with exotic ingredients I don't often find myself using. || I usually avoid chicken, unless it's something really special. I make it so often during the week that I need a break when I eat out.  || Any time of pasta. It's so easy and cheap to make that I can't justify it.
Try it:
http://www.thepedalingchef.com/main-courses/homemade-pasta || I tend to avoid fish and shellfish, unless it's in a seafood restaurant that gets daily, fresh shipments of seafood.  

Also avoid steak because it's usually crappy quality and overpriced, unless I'm at a nice, non-chain steak place that serves wet or dry-aged.  Also, I make a better one at home.

I avoid ""regular"" salads with lettuce because they are generally a waste of money.  Yogurt/beet/walnut salad, however?  All over that.

 || I avoid penne pasta. 

Don't get me wrong, I like a good penne pasta. But there's a reason that most places that don't specialize in Italian food to some degree, only offer penne. 

They can order dry penne in bulk and keep it back in the kitchen for god knows how long, mishandle and mistreat it, and still make a semi-reasonable pasta dish. 

If I'm going to eat pasta, I'd rather it wasn't the nigh indestructible, who gives a fuck about it, variety.  || I don't order a steak from any place that isn't a upscale steakhouse. A $10 t-bone is just too much of a tease. || i avoid all sea food, but thats simply because i don't like it. i also avoid all non-specialty pasta dishes. my biggest thing is that no matter where i go i never order "" just a burger"". i can count the number of times i see people order just a plain burger at a place that might have some awesome specials. || Salmon or other fish filets. Generally if I'm at a place that I can trust enough to not overcook them then there's something more exciting that I'd rather order / it's extremely expensive. || desserts, unless I am sure they made it themselves.

How do we fix our dinner problem?,"Don't know if this is the right subreddit, but here it goes. Dinner is a fight every night with my live-in girlfriend. We never agree on it. I have the palate of a 6 year old, and she doesn't. But she's also finicky and changes her mind all the time about what she wants. She knows what she doesn't want (everything) but never what she does. I'll just grab anything that I like and eat it to get it over with, but almost none of it is healthy and she won't eat what I do so that doesn't solve anything. We have a home aide for our son and she's tried to help us make lists of things we like and shown us cookbooks and there's just nothing in common. So we end up getting take out or spending twice as much on food because we have to make two things.

I also need to stop eating like this because I need to lose weight and get healthier. Anyone change their kid-like eating habits to healthier ones? I've tried to force myself to eat a few vegetables and just couldn't do it. ","I'm not sure how to solve the problems between you and your girlfriend, but your child is going to grow up with the same shitty eating habits if you don't change. Children learn by example, and if you don't eat right- neither will they because they only learned how to eat processed food. 

Good on you for wanting to change. 

Along with some of the other great suggestions in this thread, take your favourite foods, say chicken nuggets for example, and learn how to make a healthier version of it. If you need help creating something, just ask and I'll gladly help where I can. || Take what you like, and try to add one thing that you don't like to it. 

FOR EXAMPLE: let's say you like noodles a lot. (My sister went through a phase where all she ate was hot noodles and butter.) The next time you make noodles, try adding half a cup of fresh spinach to it while it's on your plate. HOLD ON! Spinach on noodles? GROSS! Stir it up a bit so that the hot noodles wilt the spinach some, this will cook the spinach and change the texture.

If you're not wild about vegetables, it's probably because you haven't found a way that they're prepared to suit your tastes. I bet you like oven fries, right? Try doing the same thing with brusselsprouts or radishes. 

The biggest obstacle is going to be yourself. You think that you know what you like, and the list is completed, but it really isn't. There are other things that you may like, but you won't/haven't given them a chance. || Why don't you try going junk food free for a month? Stay away from processed foods, anything that comes in a package, and anything with excessive amounts of salt and sugar. You can also pick a cheat day every week to make it easier on yourself. 

The thing is, if you're eating processed foods, you've gotten used to extraordinarily high amounts of salt and sugar. At first, healthy foods will taste bland or bitter to you, but your tastes will adjust after a while and you might find that the processed foods you've been eating taste too salty. Also, if you switch to a healthier diet, you will begin to crave healthier foods (I find exercise also helps with this). You will lose some of your junk food dependency, but it will be really hard at the start and easy to slip back into old habits. That's why it will be much easier to commit to a set time period like one month. 

At first, just eat the healthy foods you do like, even if that's only one dish. Hopefully you'll get so sick of it that you'll want to try start trying new healthy foods. As for your girlfriend, you should probably let her worry about her own meals for the month, because you'll have a hard enough time with your own meals. || I've done it...its taken a few years to really change my diet, but it is COMPLETELY changed from what it was a few years ago.  One little 'cheat' you can do is have a glass of wine (or two) before a meal which you don't think is appetizing.  I still have to do this when I go and have an exotic dish with foods I would NEVER prepare for myself.

Also: learn how to cook fresh foods, and try to avoid foods that come in boxes.  I make all kinds of meals out of Quinoa, Avocado, Beef, Ground Turkey, Peppers, Broccoli, Tuna, and Green Beans, and Sweet Potatoes.  All healthy stuff that I think tastes pretty 'simple' || im currently fighting this battle, trying to learn to eat healthy at 28 yrs old || The ""oven fry"" tip is spot on. As a kid I thought I hated most vegetables; as an adult I realized that I hated steamed vegetables, which is what my mom always made. Almost every vegetable is delicious when you roast it in the oven with olive oil and a bit of salt. || I've switched from beef to ground turkey and I do like sweet potatoes some but need to find a tastier way to cook them. Microwaved with salt and butter is OK. I've heard brown sugar on them is good. || Cinnamon and butter is great on sweet potatoes!  Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was that I wasn't a good cook until I learned how to cook meat properly.  All my life I thought chicken was terrible (my mother always overcooked it until it was as dry as a desert)...that changed when I bought a digital probe thermometer and learned how to cook various meats to their proper temperatures!  Chicken became moist and delicious!  Oh, another easy thing to cook is white fish.

How I almost fucked up Valentines Day dinner ,"I have to share this story from last night because it was almost a huge fail on my part. First, a little background. I love to cook and I think I am a pretty good cook too. I've been friends with this girl for a few years and we've finally started dating, which has been going very well. We enjoy a lot of the same stuffs, humor, tv shows, music, reddit... and so on. She is also a huge food nerd too, we both love food and experiencing food things together. Whether that is shopping for food, like exploring a new market or whether we go out and act like we're critics or we cook at home. She is an amazing baker and does super fancy stuff with cookies and cupcakes. I do amazing stuff with meals and the grill, at least I like to think I do.

So onto last night. I picked up a rainbow trout, it looked and smelled delicious. My plan was to do a simple pan fry with olive oil and compound butter (lemon zest, roasted garlic, salt, pepper). Sometimes I like to dust the fish with a little corn starch to add a little crunch and texture to the sear. Last night I grabbed what I thought was corn starch and proceeded to dust and season the fish. I had the pan ready and as I put the fish in the pan, my gf says to me ""Why did you put baking powder on the fish?"". I replied with ""that was corn starch and I want the fish to have some crunch without being breaded."" She then pointed me to the jar that I just put away and to my shock it was baking powder. I was devastated. I thought I completely ruined the meal. I was like fuck it, I'll finish cooking this thing and if it tastes like shit, I'll order a pizza. 

As the fish cooked, I pouted and started to beat myself up. She did a great job at trying to cheer me up, but I just needed a few minutes to get over my stupid mistake. I should have looked at the fucking jug. After 5 minutes, I was cracking jokes about how the fish needed some leavening and something about a flying fish. By now the fish was done. I plated our dinner, steamed baby potatoes tossed with the same compound butter and parsley, the pan seared fish, and a balsamic vinegar salad with apples and toasted pecans.   
To our surprise the fish wasn’t ruined at all. It actually had the same kind of crunch I was looking for. Plus it didn’t taste like baking powder. It was a very good dinner.
I’ve now done some googling and noticed baking powder is in a lot of frying recipes. Can someone explain to me why it still had a crisping effect without making the fish taste like Alka-Seltzer?

**TL;DR - Pan seared fish with baking powder and still got laid at the end of the night. Oh, why didn't the baking powder fuck up the fish?**","Baking powder is a combination of baking soda, a dry acid and a starch (usually corn starch) to keep the powder dry so it doesn't react prematurely.  Edit: The starch also makes the powder pour/measure more easily.

Once things took off you were just left with CO2, water, and a bit of corn starch and salt. || [The Food Lab](http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab/?ref=ind) over at [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com) has used baking powder (and soda) in some rather unusual ways.

Questions on Inventory Control Within Restaurants,"I'm working on some web based software to help restaurant managers/owners save on inventory and food waste costs. The software currently analyzes past sales and food usage and intelligently predicts how much of each item should be ordered for the next week. The software also provides a way to determine which foods are costing the restaurant the most money, whether it be because of waste, or overstocking. It is also able to do this all visually in a nice graph. In your opinion, restaurant redditors, what are some key features this software needs in addition to what it already offers to truly help increase profits and decrease food waste and over purchasing? What features would make this software really stand out and grab your interest? If these features were to be provided, how much of a market do you think there is for inventory assistance in the restaurant industry?","Did this about 14 years ago on Win 3.1

- Cost per pound of produce/waste loss.
- Menu cross reference for cost analysis against order of specific items. This gives accurate representation of cost/waste by menu item and allows menu ""sculpting"" to reduce loss.
- Bar code system for labeling food bins for more accurate wastage information.
- vendor tracking against waste and loss to determine which vendors are short selling food. Including integrated food scale to track weights from order to order to catch food skimming from vendor (More common than you would think in produce and meat)
- FAST receiving of items that can be done on paper first then entered later if possible.

I will go back to my design dock and see what else there was from the client.

 || Seems like it has to interface with the POS system. Who's going to enter every sale every day? || I don't have much experience with this type of software myself since we do our own inventory, but can your software handle food volume/ingredient changes at holidays? I have used software in the past but it was really annoying every time a holiday came along we had to abandon the software, inventory and then update the software with the holiday inventory. The big holidays in kitchens are usually X-mas, New Year, Easter, Mother's Day, Thanksgiving (Canadian/American).  || being from the lower ranks of the food service industry at one point, I would be extremely grateful if you did a good job on this.  The amount of food thrown away every day in every restaurant is an ignored (why?) facet of the business.  Some chefs actually take pleasure in throwing away perfectly good food.  The actual amount is a staggering, astronomical you would not believe me if I told you waste.  Please do a good job. || What would be kind of nice if you are referencing the menu would be a little calculator that will add up the number of dishes each ingredient appears in. This would be nice to help streamline inventory.

Also, as a vendor, our system has an icon that will show price movement (+/-) at a glance that I find very helpful. I think Chefs would appreciate the ability to compare vendors quickly. 

Will this program be able to do recipe costing as well? If so, including a yield calculator for ingredients would be sweet. There are plenty of databases available. The program I use does not have integrated yield calculations. 

You might want to look into the possibility of working with some broadline distributors too. Incorporating access to some of their services might be very nice for the customer. They can help you place the program too. || There is no market to sell this.    

Owner/operators don't want another layer and chains have their own systems in place.     

Unless it replaces a step instead of creating another one you will have trouble selling this software.    

You should try and get a job in a restaurant and see how owner/operators deal with ordering and inventory.    
A great number of them keep the process as simple and as primitive as possible. || You might consider adding something to tell the chef the traveling distance of the food. Some way to quickly reference if the supplier is local or not. || Awesome advice! Thanks. It's written in PHP so It would be difficult to integrate some sort of scale, but assuming there are vendors out there that short sell on food I can see how important that might be. Also, I never even thought of a barcode system, but it seems essential now that you mention it. || Yes, this has been a very difficult thing to deal with. Unfortunately, I can't see this ever being able to integrate this with a POS system. My original intentions were to just provide a very quick, intuitive interface for managers to input basic usage and waste. From their input, it would calculate and display all data that I explained above. In my short inquires with kitchen staff and waitresses during mealtimes, the POS computers in most restaurants have nothing to do with the inventory reporting and control. I will admit I don't have much experience managing a food outlet, and I know the staff aren't always the most knowledgable when it comes to logistics, but it seems even in current establishments integration with the POS is non-existent. But again, maybe I just haven't been talking to the right people. || Yes, it uses previous food usage during the previous year's holidays to determine and adjust how much should be purchased for upcoming holidays. Of course, the first year it is being used it would have no previous holiday to base off of. I am considering adding something to adjust for this as well so the restaurant does not have to wait a year before they get accurate purchasing suggestions.",24/7/2011,8,21,1311468600,food,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/iy1fu/questions_on_inventory_control_within_restaurants/
Garlic Hack. ,"Do you think this advice from a [BBC food recipe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dauphinoisepotatoes_90205) is a good approach?

I just made dauphinoise potatoes, and my garlic prep went from a couple of minutes to 30 seconds...

>Trim the ends off the garlic cloves but don't peel. Grate the cloves on a grater. The flesh will go through the fine holes and the skins will be left behind. Scrape the grated garlic flesh into the bowl with the potatoes.

I've cultivated my garlic-chopping/mincing technique ('ooh, missus!'), but just grabbing the grater and 30s later having a pile of perfectly chopped garlic was wonderful.

Any downsides to this?","Don't bother with the grater, just another piece to get in the way and wash.  Just place the flat of your knife on the cloves (trimmed of the hard end) and thump the knife with the heel of of your hand.   || Crack the garlic head & toss the single cloves into two, small metal bowls & shake them vigorously! The skins will separate and you can thin slice the cloves! Also, after handling garlic, wash your hands as normal, dry them on paper towels and then run your hands, fingers in a rapid motion over another (clean) metal bowl.

Rubber gloves, garlic press +++  

 yechhhh! bottled garlic.....  || And if you want the most of your garlic: When you have a peeled clove take your largest knife and hold it so the sharp end is pointing UP and the wider, dull side is pointing towards the cutting board. Start using a chopping motion on the garlic and you will crush and separate it instead of just mincing it. Give yourself enough room to have leverage and crush the damn thing but it works great - tons of precious garlic juice unleashed!
 || I grate garlic all the time. Never thought to do it with skins on. Thanks for the tip! || I usually just grab the garlic on each end and twist the garlic clove between my fingers and the peel comes off pretty easily.  It may take all of fifteen seconds, and then you can prep the garlic any way you like. || It doesn't get any better than [this.](http://www.amazon.com/Zak-Designs-Z-Rol-Garlic-Peeler/dp/B00004RDDP) You get perfectly peeled **whole** cloves in a matter of seconds, it's easy to clean and you can cut or mash them as you want. But most important: You can avoid coming in contact with garlic juices, thus you don't have stinky fingers for the next 3 days.

If you simply want mashed garlic, you can always put them in the garlic press with the skin, it will be left behind.  || The best hack is to get pre-peeled garlic (some stores are doing this) and then a microplane.  Don't have to worry about peeling at all, or cleaning out a messy press.  || I have one of these and it really is very effective at peeling garlic. However, I gave it up and use the knife-smash method because most of the meals I make use chopped garlic, not whole. Afterwards I wash my hands and use a little stainless steel card to take the stinkiness away, but any stainless steel will work--like your faucet. || I kind of like having stinky fingers after peeling garlic. || I use a garlic press lots (if I'm too lazy for a knife flat smash/mince rock), but always think the 'extruded' garlic flesh is pitiful compared to what is left behind in the press.

Which is why I was taken by the (greater-) grater approach: peeled and minced in seconds in a single pass, with next to no waste, and no overhead.

Gotta be honest, this implement you've linked to looks like a small length of hosepipe. Keeping an open mind, I'll take a look...I'm usually looking for minced garlic for recipes though; but for clean, whole cloves (stews/pot dishes) then this does look useful, thanks (but still like a bit of hosepipe).

I got really sad at the grocery store the other day.,"My wife and I have 4 month old twins at home. Our ability to do much else than take care of them has taken a pretty big hit as of late. That includes having time to make decent meals for ourselves after work. That was something that we really enjoyed before having kids. We were always cooking and trying new recipes. Now, we just don't have the time or energy to do all that work.

The grocery store. So, I went to do the shopping last weekend while she watched the kids. Due to the above lack of time/energy I didn't buy near as many fresh fruits and vegetables and fresh meats that we would normally buy. Instead, I stocked up on a lot of pre-prepared meals & snacks. Frozen stuff. Items that come in boxes and feature quick prep times. Stuff we never usually buy, but will get us through.

This is where I got sad. I had a cart full of stuff. Before I checked out, I was thinking that this was going to cost me a fortune (I didn't really check the price of things I was grabbing).  Instead, when the cashier was done, my bill was probably 35% less than our usual grocery bill, and I had actually bought more stuff.

I can't believe that all that pre-processed crap is as cheap as it is. No wonder this country has a serious health problem. Especially with the economy as it is. People without much income have try to stretch every last food dollar and that usually means buying more chemicals than actual food.

I'm sorry if this is common knowledge to everyone else. I just had my eyes opened and was wondering if anyone else had had the same experience.

TL;DR: Processed food crap is way cheaper than it's fresher healthier alternatives.","The documentary Food, Inc. suggests that corn, soy and wheat, the crops that make up the bulk of manufactured food, are inexpensive because they are heavily subsidized.  Part of the lobbyist pressure for those subsidies comes from the food manufacturers, but in addition, in the case of corn and soy, beef and chicken ranchers lobby to keep these cheap to use as animal feed.  Fresh vegetables?  No subsidies. In the vision of corporate food, vegetables are little more than a condiment for the main course of corn, soy, wheat, beef and chicken. It's back-asswards, and it's made us fat. || If you have a Trader Joes near you I highly recommend going there.  Their frozen, pre-prepared foods are your best bet.  Still flavorful and they don't feel as unnatural as ""regular"" frozen and premade foods.  I wok full-time and go to school; I have no time to cook during the semester and this is the way I go.

EDIT: I was going to fix ""I **wok** full-time"" to work but I've decided it stays. || I feel your pain, truly. Our twins are 9 months old, and we've been in the exact same boat. It's extraordinarily difficult to find time and money to cook with little ones that age. It was extremely important to us to continue to cook, as it felt like it was necessary for our sanity. My husband and I have always enjoyed cooking, and I have a very limited diet, so pre-packaged foods aren't really an option for me. 

We did a lot of things in bulk. If you have a rice cooker, you can achieve a lot for not much money. We did chili with rice, stir fry with rice, curry with rice. You can make a ton with fresh ingredients, it doesn't cost a lot, and it goes pretty far. We also made a ton of spaghetti and lasagna. 

It won't be long before your babies start entertaining themselves and each other more, and it makes such a huge difference! Just hang in there, and you'll be back to cooking soon enough. :) || If you look at most stuff, the highest calorie/$ items are junk. When you are poor and need to eat to survive, you make due. I moved out of my parents 2 years ago ( I am now 22), and I have noticed a significant change in the way I eat. I have gain weight because I cant eat as well as I used to because of other living expenses. No granted, I am not using that as an excuse...I am the first to admit I could cut costs in other places.

Its all about quick and easy. I love cooking, and I wish I could cook 3 full meals a day...but it just isnt possible. It is sad that food that has all this shit added to it is cheaper than pure natural food. When I lived at home I ate mostly orgnaic/natural, rarely ate fast food, etc.... now it isnt in my budget. I would have loved to continue that life style...but compare $100 of groceries at the natural/organic market compared to a grocery giant and its not possible to survive. Prices for ""healthy"" food is out of control.... || You bought 10 pounds of salt?  Maybe?  And inferior quality stuff all dresed up in preservs, et?  I'm not sure.  Just sayin'.

But, I know the feeling.  We raised five kids..no twins but a couple of them a year apart.

You can make baby food out of good fresh stuff you like to eat with a food processor and further cooking so they can eat it.  But....they are a bit young for that yet.

It won't seem long that they will be eating what you eat......

 || This always surprises me when I hear it. I live in Australia and it's not the case here; most of my food bill is fresh veggies which are about $2 - $5 a kilo (sometimes down to 70 cents a kilo for pumpkins and potatoes and such) and pasta, rice, milk etc which are ridiculously cheap. If I bought processed foods / ready made meals I would easily double or triple my grocery bill. Granted, I don't buy meat, which saves me money - it's $4 for assorted chicken wings and up to $10 or $20 a kilo for pig or cow. || An itemized list with prices would be nice to see.    
It' important to compare the caloric and nutrient values as well when saying processed/prepared food is much cheaper.    
Often it is not, in your case, you may just be getting less of what's good about food.
     || I was just thinking about this the other day as I was checking out with a $150 grocery bill. Half my items were fresh foods (meats and produce) yet like you said, the processed foods are so much cheaper. 
They way I look at it is would I rather pay a little more now or pay with high cholesterol/diabetes etc. later? Of course, if you cannot afford better food and need to eat, that is not an option. It just sucks that eating healthy has become a class issue like everything else in America.  || First: There are cookbooks you can buy that teach you to cook on a budget. If the budget is really tight, Start with a few key things: buy whole chickens, buy dry beans, buy rice. buy in season vegetables (there are books, and online resources that teach you seasonality). Buy essential vegetables (ie. Onion, carrots, celery) they're cheap, high in vitamins and widely available. make sure you have olive oil (you can also cut your olive oil with regular canola oil, both for higher heat cooking, and to stretch the flavor). Familiarise yourself with asian cuisines (Asian cooking is really making something awesome out of nothing, plus if you have asian supermarkets near you, it's some cultural learnings =P ) you can do so much with basic ingredients and a little know-how. As a culinary graduate and a chef in the trade for 5 years, I can say: The best cook is the cook who knows how to let the food shine. Just educate yourself with some online recipes. Take ONE day that you have off, cook with your kids - have them cut vegetables.. you know spend family time, make it fun, and more importantly have them help you get the work done. Hell, educate them as well, that way they grow up knowing how to live on a budget too.

The items I said you can buy are all just dirt basic ingredients, and only one possibility you can go with for cheap and good menu planning.

Tl;DR Read menu planning books; Make meals for throughout the week in a day (aka. as much prep as needed); get the family involved to make the task easier. 

edit: Didn't see the kids were toddlers, it's all on wife husband teamwork =D || No, it really isn't. 

Learn to cook.

Edit: OK - little tipsy, I see you don't have time to cook... but you need to find that time. <3",15/4/2011,23,23,1302897933,food,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/gqzwh/i_got_really_sad_at_the_grocery_store_the_other/
The Problem with Breakfast,"I try to eat relatively healthy, I really do.  But companies these days make it tough –you can’t buy a healthy product even if you try.  

I generally like to prepare my own food from scratch –that way I know what I’m eating and I’m certain it’s good for me.  Unfortunately, I also like to sleep in, which occasionally results in me grabbing a bagel or such for breakfast.  Today, I made the mistake of opting for a muffin bought from a chain café.

To call it a muffin is probably a misnomer.  Sure, at first glance it *looks* like a muffin.  A random person on the street, if asked to identify it, would almost certainly call it a muffin.  I had actually made the assumption that it was a bran muffin, as it was about the correct color and didn’t have a solid inch of brown sugar or syrup on top (although it was lightly sprinkled with brown sugar, a topping which is, apparently, impossible to avoid entirely).  It was only after biting into it that I discovered my mistake.  

Far too light and sugary for a bran muffin, I was no longer sure entirely what I was eating.  It was only upon reaching the center of the muffin, to discover that it was stuffed with some sort of sugar and cream cheese mixture that I discovered the truth.  It wasn’t a muffin; it was a piece of cake.  The frosting was just on the inside.

So, here’s my question: when the hell did dessert become breakfast?!?  Seriously, there was a reason I wanted to buy a muffin instead of a Boston Kreme Donut.  Is it even possible to purchase a real muffin these days?  WTF people.
","Why can't we have nutritious breakfast options like we had in the old days with Crunch Berries and Fruity Pebbles?   || you could of just asked if it was a bran muffin.  || People like fat and sugar in the morning so businesses cater to that.


Actually let me rephrase. People like fat and sugar all the time, so businesses offer it all day long. The only way to get around it is to do some research and figure out which places offer solid options for people not looking to indulge every hour of the day. || I get what you're saying entirely.  Even cereals often have the nutritional capacity of some cookies or wafers.  Muffins (even if they are bran muffins) are also essentially cake anymore, even if they don't have the cream cheese frosting filling.
'I can understand this type of breakfast on the weekend, or maybe once a week though, and businesses really do get off on this consumer's right to indulge, so it's made much more constant now.  Breakfast happens to be a convenient way to fit that in. || Oh shut up. No one makes breakfast ""tough"". You're just being a bitch who likes to blame others for your shortcomings. 

The easiest breakfast ever: oatmeal, add fruit if you wish, add peanut butter if you wish. Done. The oatmeal is extremely cheap at the Supermarket. Use double the amount of water as oats. I use 1/3 cup oat meal and 2/3 cup water. You can cook instant oatmeal plain for 90 seconds on high in the microwave. I add a banana before cooking so I do 2 minutes. This isn't rocket science. 

You could also have left over dinner for breakfast. No one is stopping you from doing that. Eggs are good protein. Have an egg with some left over rice, or fruit, or whatever. Or just have an apple with peanut butter on top. You don't even need  a refrigerator or something to cook your breakfast in.  || In Canada, dessert has always been breakfast. Pancakes covered in maple syrup, McGriddle, coffee with double sugar and double cream, donuts.... I personally like to eat last night's left over. || Yeah I had something of similar deliciousness when I went to dunkin donuts.  Although I knew I was eating a heart attack and wasn't planning on eating another one any time soon.

It was at that point that I realized most people will think ""Dunkin Donuts serves breakfast, so this must be what breakfast is."" and buy whatever is there in front of them as breakfast.  What I ate was dessert, and a particularly bad one at that.  It boggles my mind that anyone would think otherwise, but I know that they do. || In our house, we will cook bacon over the weekend so we can just heat it up in the microwave during the week. Typically do the same with sausage. I cook eggs fresh every morning, cooking time 15mins, and doesn't need to be checked up on. || It is unfortunate that if you are not at home or a store, it is hard to find a breakfast item that isn't sweet.  Muffins, fruit, even oatmeal is all too sweet for me, so I am left with bagels.  Every time. || It's so sneaky that some companies actually put coloring into their products to make it seem like it's 'whole grain' or 'fibrous'.

Tacos De Carne Adobada.  Homemade recipe passed down between 3 generations.  You want authentic Mexican?  Here it is.  Not for the faint of heart (literally),"***A disclaimer*** This is a FAMILY Recipe being shared through the kindess of my heart.  Please do not use this recipe for profit, as I am providing it for free with the understanding that you will enjoy good tasting food.  Also, this recipe is a VERY high fat food.

[tacos Finished product](http://i.imgur.com/mWxD9.jpg ""OMG!! SO GOOD"")

and NOW  The recipe.

RECIPE LIST OF INGREDIENTS:

* 5 Pork Shoulder blade steaks (BONE IN)
* 10 Chiles California Secos, Sin Cola, Semillas removidas.  (Dry California Chiles without stem, seeds removed)
* 1/8 Teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/8 Teaspoon ground clove
* 1/8 Teaspoon ground black pepper
* A pinch of marjoram (Dry)
* ½ Teaspoon White Vinegar
* Salt to taste
* 1/6th piece of [Mexican Chocolate round](http://www.mexgrocer.com/2544.html). (LA Abuelita or similar)
* 1 Garlic Clove
* 1 piece of Cinnamon stick (approx.  1 inch in size)
* 2 stems fresh Oregano (Leaves ONLY)
* LARD, YES I SAID LARD.
* Tortillas (small taco sized ones preferred, but either size works)

* Optional:  Green Onion bulbs. White Onion.  Cilantro.

Let's get started!  First off, make sure you have the correct chiles.  You should use [California Chiles](http://i.imgur.com/VaEYl.jpg""Beautiful chiles"") only, as any other dry chile could result in a horrible flavor.  You are going to want to remove [the stem](http://i.imgur.com/g6Xah.jpg ""take the stems out"") from the chiles.  Under running water, shake the seeds out and [wash them out](http://i.imgur.com/nImeS.jpg ""SEEDS SEEDS SEEDS!!"") get ready to boil these suckers.  [Boil them](http://i.imgur.com/hFTe2.jpg ""pot looks bad from the dishwasher"") for approximately 10-15 minutes until  they start to foam a little.  Now,  get the [Following ingredients](http://i.imgur.com/PyNMk.jpg ""all together as a happy family"") together in a small plate: Mexican Chocolate, Garlic, ground ginger, ground clove, ground black pepper, marjoram, oregano, and cinnamon.  Once the chiles are done boiling, throw them in the blender with approximately 3/4 cup of water that boiled the chile, and about 1/4 cup of regular water.  Throw the rest of the ingredients into [the blender](http://i.imgur.com/J9FMh.jpg ""look how pretty"").  [Blend](http://i.imgur.com/NaFdZ.jpg ""yes it's the magic bullet!"") for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, until well blended.  Before turning off, add a splash of [vinegar](http://i.imgur.com/v07ef.jpg ""not too much!"") and salt.  Add the salt and taste.  If you want it saltier, add more salt, get it to your liking.    Now, you are going to want to get your [pork steaks](http://i.imgur.com/Vot27.jpg ""Pork the other white meat!"") ready to marinade.  Once the chile is blended, put your steaks into a ziplock bag and pour chile into the bag a little at a time, getting the steaks well covered before adding the next steak.  Repeat until you get all your steaks in the bag and pour remainder of the chile marinade into the [bag](http://i.imgur.com/Io9Mr.jpg ""Ready!"") to make sure you got every piece covered.  [Refrigerate overnight or 36 hours if possible](http://i.imgur.com/mKzsA.jpg ""This batch was refrigerated for approx. 36 hours"").  

Once your ready to make your tacos, it's time to get a cookin!  Get your frying pan and add the [lard](http://i.imgur.com/KjRZw.jpg ""Manteca!"") enough to cover about half the meat when frying.  Now fry [the steaks up!](http://i.imgur.com/rKWP3.jpg ""Fry baby fry!"").  Take [precautions](http://i.imgur.com/PpQtG.jpg ""I love this thing!"") as this is lard you are dealing with, and it will splash, burning the shit out of you.  Cook about 6 or 7 minutes and [flip the meat](http://i.imgur.com/rqaFb.jpg ""Look at that color!"").  Cook another 6 or 7 minutes.  Make sure you are cooking your pork thoroughly as uncooked pork is unsafe to consume.  some burning might occur at the edges, but trust me it tastes awesome.  this is [done](http://i.imgur.com/oSsML.jpg ""love the color!"").  Take out of your pan and onto a cutting board.  YOu are going to want to [remove the bone](http://i.imgur.com/EuZrI.jpg ""bye bye bone, thanks for the flavor!"").  Now you will want to cut the meat into pieces big enough for your tacos.  I can't advise on the size because some people like bigger chunks, others smaller ones.  This is the time to get your [green onions](http://i.imgur.com/1TJAW.jpg ""fry these suckers too!"") and fry them for about 3 minutes each, turning often. Chop up your white onion and cilantro to [add to your tacos](http://i.imgur.com/ExB4c.jpg ""can't have tacos without this!"").  Now [get another pan](http://i.imgur.com/ZFLXo.jpg ""hot hot hot!"") nice and hot.  Grab your tortillas and [dip a corner](http://i.imgur.com/8F7A3.jpg ""tortillas have no corners"") of the tortilla in the lard from the meat you just cooked.  throw it [on the pan](http://i.imgur.com/9iYOK.jpg ""cook!"") and [rub it around](http://i.imgur.com/PJ4yT.jpg ""rub rub rub"") to get the grease of the lard on the tortilla and get it to cook a bit.  don't forget to flip a few times, as it can burn.  do this for about 1 minute each tortilla, and it's [done](http://i.imgur.com/CL0UB.jpg ""mmm"").  I do 2 tortillas per taco, alot of taco sellers do this.  Once you are done with your tortillas, put the chopped meat onto the tortilla, top with the cilantro and onion.  your [tacos](http://i.imgur.com/mWxD9.jpg ""OMG!!"") are done!  These are very fattening because of the tortillas,  but the flavor alone will blow you away, and you are certain to never want to go to a taco truck/restaurant again.

I hope you REALLY enjoy this, but remember, don't eat these too often!

EDIT:  Here is the [album!](http://imgur.com/a/utLzX#VaEYl ""enjoy"")

EDIT 2:  Some people asked me if there is a sauce that accompanies the tacos a la ""taco truck"" type.  There is, but I am not really a fan of salsas on my tacos (YES I AM REALLY MEXICAN) so I don't make it.  I have the recipe, so I'm including it for those that want a little spicyness.

SALSA DE TOMATILLO:

*  10 to 12 Fresh Tomatillos, flaky skins removed.
*  8-10 Chiles de Arbol (or Tree Chile)  you can find at any market in the hispanic aisle.  They look like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_de_%C3%A1rbol ""sorry Wikipedia link!"")
*  Salt to taste.

Boil the Tomatillos for approximately 20-30 minutes, on high heat.  You will want to make sure the tomatillos are fully boiled and cooked.  They may release a nasty gooish substance making the water gooey, so once done, discard the water.  While the tomatillos are boiling, place a pan on the stove and toast the chiles until dark on both sides.  *CAUTION* you will want to open windows, and turn your overhead fan on, because you WILL BE COUGHING from the smell!  Once the chiles are toasted, remove the stems.  In a blender, throw the chiles and the tomatillos in and blend.  If it isn't blending well because it's too dry, add water, a little at a time, just enough to get everything thoroughly blended together.  Add salt to taste. You now have a shit load of salsa for your tacos.","Why oh why isn't there more content on foodit than this?! Thanks! || To turn this recipe into birria you will need to do the following:

The recipe for the chile marinade remains the same. 

The meat you will need to use:

* 1 pound beef foreshank (Chamorro De Res)
* 1 Pound Pork foreshank (Chamorro De Puerco/Cerdo)
* 1 Pound beef round meat, or cubed beef (Carne De Res para Barbacoa or Mixto de Res)

marinade the meat over night.  In a pot, add the meat with the chile marinade and add water (along the edge or through the side, so as to not remove the marinade from the meat) enough to cover 3/4 of the meat in your pot.  add another small splash of vinegar to the pot and boil on high until bubbling.  lower heat to a simmer, cover and cook for approximately 2 hours.  (If you have a slow cooker or crock pot use it instead).  Serve in a bowl, it is delicious!

"Quick Pho, does it exist?","Cold winter days are rolling in and like many people, Pho has jumped right back to the top of my list as my favorite comfort food.  I've frequented many locales and tried many Pho joints and I so very much love it.  

Now, my question is a bit blasphemous since anyone who's made amazing Pho before knows it takes upwards of two days and great delicious ingredients.  I'm a college student and making Pho from scratch or even going to grab a bowl for 6 bucks is still puts hurt on the wallet.  I miss my father's Pho so much but will have to settle for half decent. 

To tide these years of penny pinching over and this cold winter, does anyone know of any ""decent"" instant pho or pho stock (powder, bullions, pastes, etc)?  

Edit: If you're going to downvote please give an explanation.  I'm just looking for an alternative until I get home in the summer! Thanks!
 ","I've made ""quick"" Pho many a time; it does not taste quite as good as the full two day version, but it is still perfectly good. It is not instant, but it only takes 20 minutes or so, and uses one pot. I do it whenever I am in a hurry, or don't have the equipment to do it right.

What I would recommend for doing it quick and cheap:
1. Beef or chicken broth (can be from bouillon or ""better than bouillon"")
2. Fish sauce
3. Spices (whatever mix sounds good, but I like cloves, cinnamon, powdered ginger and powdered coriander; a lot of people like anise as well)
4. Rice noodles
6. (optional) some sort of meat (I like chicken if I am trying to penny pinch)

If I where to try to make instant Pho that was reasonably good, I would probably mix the fish paste, bouillon cubes (ground up) and spices into a paste, put it in a jar and store it in the fridge. You should be able to mix that with water, toss in some rice noodles, and probably cook in the microwave. A little pre-preperation, but then it is pretty well instant. || [deleted] || Our home-version has been turning out pretty good, and takes maybe 20-30 minutes start to soup.  

Beef bullion and water (or boxed/can beef broth, but it's easy to keep a jar of bullion on hand) in a pot to heat up.  Boil some rice noodles for a few, strain and rinse.  Sautee chicken tenderloins in chili garlic sauce, teriyaki or whatever you like/have on hand.  Toss in any of the usual suspects that you have/grow/keep around, thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, spinach, carrots, jalapenos, sriracha, chili paste, hoisin, etc.  

I'm sure add'l sauces, seasonings would make it better, but try starting from there and keep adjusting every time.  We freestyle it and it's some of my favorite food these days.  

And again, beef bullion is cheap.  Might be 4-5 bucks for a jar, but you can make a crapload of soup with that much.  They also make veggie/mushroom bullion/stock/base, chicken variants, just look on the soup aisle near the beef broth.  

I'm sure pho fanatics would laugh at me, but it's still super delish and you can make a meal for 4 for 10 bucks and have ingredients left that you won't buy again for a long while.  Investing in decent bowls, spoons, sauces and stuff is definitely worth it over time.  || We buy [this](http://imgur.com/DgkTW.jpg) at the local Asian market. Just add some cooked rice noodles, thinly sliced onions, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, and some meat. The can is 28 oz. Unfortunately, I can't remember the price-but it's cheap and quick. || Two days?? Can you maybe point me to an authentic recipe? I am certainly not a Vietnamese food expert, but that seems excessive for soup, especially with all the raw ingredients that go in at the end. I let my regular beef stock cook for about 10 hours, but I do this overnight in the oven set on warm (180°F), so there is very little work or monitoring involved. Do you have to make the stock and then do a second long cooking with the spices?

I totally understand wanting an instant version of pho, I'm just having real trouble wrapping my head around the real stuff taking two days to make. || Quoc Viet makes a Beef Pho Soup Base that is excellent. 

Looks like this:

[http://vietnamesesupermarket.com/images/products/detail/IMG_7747.JPG]

You can buy it at almost any asian supermarket.  || Six bucks? I must be pretty spoiled. There is an extremely large Vietnamese population in Oklahoma City so noodle houses are a dime a dozen. Three to five bucks in these here parts.

Thanks for asking about this though. We have experimented with a quicker method and it just doesn't seem right. Everybody gave me a lot of suggestions that are sure to help. || Honestly, the best thing to do is when you;re making a normal batch is to make like 20 gallons of the broth and freeze as much as you can.

Yesterday I learned that MSG is no good for me,"Ok, so I've never been a big junk food junkie, but I used to do KFC/McD/etc once in a while. I did a 7 day detox diet about 2 months ago and have been eating healthier since then, so my body was relatively toxin free (apart from those that I give myself with cigarettes and booze).

Yesterday, I craved McDonald's for the first time in maybe a year or so...went there, grabbed a fillet-o-fish and a double cheeseburger, ate them, and took a Big Mac home, which I ate about an hour later.

Another 2 hours later I'm on the bean bag watching a movie with the ladyfriend when suddenly all the muscles in my neck start aching, I start feeling nauseous, my heartbeat gets quite a bit ""louder"" (i.e. noticeable) and I get a pretty woozy, tingling feeling all over my body.

I was getting really worried as I felt like I was falling ill with something serious. Thinking about what might cause the condition, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't eaten junk food in months and that might be the reason. So I look up MSG on trusty Wikipedia, it has a link to [health effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid_%28flavor%29#Research_into_health_effects) and what do I see?

""The most prominent symptoms are numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back, general weakness and palpitations""

and a bit further down...

""[Symptoms] have included burning sensations, numbness, tingling, feelings of warmth, facial pressure or tightness, chest pain, headache, nausea, rapid heartbeat, bronchospasm in people with asthma, drowsiness, and weakness.""

Umm. Yea. Kinda disconcerting really. Anyone else here who noticed a similar effect?","[deleted] || My understanding is that McDonald's don't use MSG... :| || Yeah, a sore neck couldn't possibly be the result of sitting in a beanbag watching TV, and becoming overly aware of and concerned about your body and heartbeat (and already feeling guilty about the ""evil"" food you ate earlier) couldn't possibly have brought on a [panic attack](http://www.anxietypanic.com/signs.html).

From your own link:
""Symptoms attributed to the Chinese restaurant syndrome are rather common and unspecific."" 
""While many people believe that monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the cause of these symptoms, an association has never been demonstrated under rigorously controlled conditions, even in studies with people who were convinced that they were sensitive to the compound.""

MSG is just a sodium salt form of glutamate which exists in plenty of food that doesn't fit into your junk food box. When dissolved in liquid, the glutamate is released from the sodium, and there is no longer anything more ""artificial"" in your food than is in a hunk of parmesan cheese.

I appreciate that you are trying to live healthy (ish), but you should worry about the sodium content, calories, bad fats, refined sugar and preservatives in your junk food long before you start worrying about MSG, and there's nothing in there (barring an e. coli outbreak or chemical contamination) that you can't safely have in moderation. || [deleted] || until yesterday i thought i didn't notice the difference between MSG and non-MSG foods. and yes, i read the entire article, i saw that bit too...i'm just a bit surprised by how precisely the wiki description matched what i felt like and thought i'd ask around whether anyone else had experienced anything similar. || [first link i found on google tells a different story](http://www.msgexposed.com/boat-loads-of-msg-in-mcdonalds-food-are-you-lovin-it/)

edit: [ouch](http://www.msgexposed.com/hidden-sources-of-msg-monosodium-glutamate-on-food-ingredient-labels/) || i disagree. it wasn't just a stiff neck, felt way different. i didn't feel guilty at all about eating McD food, i'm not some organic food purist. and lastly, i'm a really relaxed person and have never had anything even close to a panic attack.

...but i'm fully with you on the point that MSG is probably a lesser evil compared to the other things you listed :-) || english as a second language strikes back - cheers for letting me know, mr. tadpole. || Actually, he used nauseous correctly.

Yesterday I was diagnosed with Oral Allergy Syndrome.  Basically I'm allergic to some raw foods... the best raw foods.,">Over the past year or so I've noticed a weird sensitivity to some raw fruits and vegetables.  
Every time I ate a peach, apple, or carrot (and many more besides), my mouth and lips would get really really itchy and sometimes even develop cankersores.  However, __the problem would disappear if the offending plants were cooked__.

>So yesterday I had an appointment with an allergist, who asked me a few questions and then schooled my ass in the nuanced field of inter-related allergies.  

>I'm allergic to tree pollen, and he told me that this is what has caused my OAS.  Birch is related to many pit fruits and almonds (the only nut to cause my symptoms), and other vegetables and fruits can look similar enough to the birch/pits protein that causes my allergy to cast Confuse Ray on my antibodies.  

>Treatment is also pretty shitty.  As in there is none.  He said I can take an antihistamine a few hours before I eat a raw fruit, but it might not work.  And even then, usually I just want to grab an apple, not plan hours ahead for it.  



AND SO, /r/food, I need your help in finding me inventive ways to destroy the volatile chemical that brings me pain.  I want to enjoy the taste of raw fruits and veggies, without cooking them too much.  
I'm a decent cook, but I'm out of practice.  I need a refresher in minimal-cooking cooking!","I have the same problem, and as a professional food writer and recipe developer, it's a big problem to have.

I've found that adding acid can help cut the effects. For instance, mashed avocado I can't eat, but add some lime to make guacamole, and it's a lot more tolerable. I usually try and have something acidic on hand to drink with raw produce if I know I'm going to have it, like lemonade, for example.

The worst for me seems to be raw soy milk. It coats my mouth and my whole throat and lips get swollen. Horrible. || I haven't eaten fresh fruits or veggies since I was a little kid because of my oral allergies, which sucks because my favorite foods are all fruits.

I have gotten really good at making fruit desserts with little or no extra sugar and just enough cooking to get rid of the itching, but I still miss things like crisp crunchy apples and fresh juicy water mellon.

Make sure you taste small bits of new things when you're travelling, though.  I frequently encountered delicious new edibles that would leave me barely able to breath and in enormous discomfort while travelling abroad as a child (after a scare in haiti my parents finally took me to a doctor and she was the one who told me about OAS).  As somebody who likes to try everything at least once, I have learned to keep some benadryl handy for those ""I'm sure it will be fine"" dinners that leave my throat lined with itchy hives. || > Every time I ate a peach, apple, or carrot

Cobbler, pie and cake. Problem solved. || Same allergy here. Watch out, because sometimes you might get a reaction unexpectedly. I LOVE bananas, but I couldn't eat a whole one because they always made me itchy. I would usually steal a bite of my boyfriend's if he was having one, and that was okay. One day, though, I had a horrible reaction. My entire face swelled up so badly within 5 minutes that I was practically unrecognizable, and my ears and throat were so swollen I could barely hear or swallow. Strangely, my nose swelled up too, to the point where it was almost twice its normal size. 

Anyway, I took some benadryl and everything eventually returned to normal, but I'll never touch a banana again, not even when cooked. I'd only taken maybe a 1 cm bite, and it's scary to think what would have happened if I'd eaten more. 

Watch out for apples too, I've heard of people unexpectedly going into anaphylactic shock from them as well. 

As for eating advice, I blanch peaches in boiling water for a few seconds, then just slide off the peel before eating. You don't boil it long enough to cook it, so it tastes and feels pretty much the same in your mouth, sans peel, especially if you shock it in ice cold water immediately after to stop the cooking process.  || Crap that sucks!  Unfortunately cooking is the best way I can think of to denature the proteins.  Other ways would involve changing the pH of the fruit to denature it.  I think it would be tougher to do than heat.  I unfortunately do not know enough about the protein structure to really help you out.  But you have my sympathy.

Hell if you are like me, you will just eat the fruit and live with the consequences.  I get a soar throat if I eat anything with to much cocoa, and dark chocolate is the food of gods in my mind. || [deleted] || huh - i might have the same allergy. My mouth gets really swollen, hot and itchy when i eat fruits with pits in the centre. I had no idea what was going on || For the veggies, try learn to cook Chinese. I'm Chinese and everything I ever make is cooked. || I have the same thing, but I notice it with only certain fruits and veggies. If you're willing to put up with a little pain, try a variety of different types and figure out if any of them are okay for you. For example, the more common types of apples, like Braeburn and Fuji, irritate my throat a lot, but Pink Ladies and Honeycrisps don't. Try organic ones, for some reason organic carrots don't set off the reaction like non-organic ones do for me.  || I have the same exact thing. I couldn't eat cherries, apples, peaches, mango, bananas, and a bunch of other stuff. I started getting allergy shots and it's made it a lot better.

"Ask /r/Food: What are some good resources to learn how to cook, without all the recipes?","This question probably comes up a lot, but I actually have something more specific in mind. 99% of all the food resources on the internet and TV I've found want to teach you recipes. And while that's all well and good, I'd much rather learn the stuff behind the scenes. What does it mean to braise? Why do you do it? When do you do it? How do you balance a sauce? 

The only thing I've been able to find so far is Good Eats. I really dislike just memorizing a bunch of recipes, because to me the most fun to be had in the kitchen is just grabbing up a bunch of ingredients and seeing what can be made. It seems to me that there is a real body of knowledge behind cooking that can help greatly in learning to improvise and really cook, instead of the sort of paint-by-numbers that a lot of cooking shows and websites run through. Please /r/Food, are there any other resources to learn the art behind cooking rather than just memorizing recipes?","A fun way to learn about the process of cooking is by watching Alton Brown:  http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/GEFP/index.htm  - click one of the Index's on the left hand side to get to the list of episodes.  Click into an episode, and towards the bottom, you'll see links to videos posted on YouTube. || Alton Brown's cookbooks are great for this. **I'm Just Here For the Food** is for cooking, and **I'm Just Here For More Food** is for baking. Look into those. || [Harold McGee](http://www.curiouscook.com/cook/on_food.php)'s book: On Food and Cooking. Also, check out his column in NY Times. || [Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Ratio-Simple-Behind-Everyday-Cooking/dp/1416566112) might be a book you'll find interesting.  Do a sneak peek inside and see if it's what you're looking for.  [Here](http://blog.ruhlman.com/) is a link to Michael Ruhlman's blog.  Apparently he has an app for the ratios.  He also has a new book, The Elements of Cooking, but I haven't read that one. || For me it's always been:

1. think of what I want to eat 

2. Google a recipe

3. Vaguely follow the recipe, google terms I don't understand

4. Eat and ponder what would make it better

5. Make the hopefully 'better' version next time
 || the art of cooking is not encyclopaedic knowledge, and thus is not acquired via theory but via practice. practice practice practice. for sure the best way to learn how to cook. sorry i can't be of more help but you'll get a hang, and understand the consequences, complications,... of every technique you want to try out once you've done it yourself. loads of practice will also give you an understanding of 'what goes with what', so you can expand your experience by improvising, making remembering recipes redundant. || I'm a professional chef. If your just getting started, recipe's are a great way to to teach you how different ingredients work with each other. A novice combining things together still has a chance of making an edible meal that they them selves will think ""hey this is good"" but I would (most likely) tare you a new asshole on what you did wrong if I tasted it. 

lets look at wine for an example, A staple in french and western european cooking (among other nationalities)
if your making a sauce and use to much wine, what do you do?
do you even know what wine does in a sauce?
how do you cut its acidity?
Do you know what flavors balance it?

now this is ONE ingredient. One... only one, out of millions of possible ingredients EVERY single one of them acting different then the other.

My advice to you sir is use recipes. Once you are confident that you have what it takes to create on your own. Start with trinities. Do not rush into complexity of flavor profiles. Use only three (main) ingredients for your flavor. That will teach you the relationship of various ingredients. Make chicken noodle soup using various trinities. Make classic chicken noodle soup using carrots, onions and celery. Then make an asian one using ginger, garlic and soy sauce etc. Learn about the harmony between them.

Now I am about to tell you some very good advice. Advice that a lot of professional cooks don't even know. You ready? here we go: DO NOT become a ""shit in a pot"" cook.
in other words, DO NOT keep throwing stuff into a meal and adding and adding under the guise that ""more of a good thing is always better"". You will fuck up and complicate everything you make.
I say it again: NEVER develop this habit.

remember, cooking is an art and should be respected and enjoyed

Ask Food: I'm in Long Beach and LA until Saturday morning. I'm a foodie from Baltimore. Where should I eat?,"Caveats:

* No fast-food. No In-N-Out, no Del Taco. I can get crap like that at home. Taco Trucks are an option. 
* I have a budget of around $50 per person per meal. Tonight, it'll likely be just me. I like lighter lunches.
* I like most food. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is heavy, buttery sauces. That makes Italian a little on-and-off.
* I love places that pair food & beer, or food & whiskey. [The Brewer's Art](http://www.thebrewersart.com/) is one of my favorite places back home, and it *is* my favorite bar.

It's 5:30, here. I'm going to grab a granola bar, shower, and nap. I'd love some input from you guys.  I'm more than willing to report back my experiences. ","Check out the beer selection at Father's Office (Santa Monica & Culver City) and have their burger. I'd pick the Culver City location over Santa Monica due to them having full liquor license and much more space to sit.

Get Sinaloan/Nayarit style Mexican food at Mariscos Chente in LA. It's all seafood, amazing shrimp and fish dishes. They source all their seafood from Mexico. I'm partial to camarones checo and pescado zarandeado. 

Try Oaxacan food at Monte Alban (moles, goat taco, etc.) on the Santa Monica/LA border or at Guelaguetza near Koreatown on Olympic.

Eat southern thai food at Jitlada in Thaitown (Hollywood). Make sure to order dishes off their southern menu and not just the regular thai stuff. 

Eat at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Great beer selections and very good babyback ribs.

Get the Odessa sandwich at Moscow Deli in Costa Mesa.

All of the places mentioned above are fairly inexpensive and way under $50/pp.

Some higher end choices.

Sushi at Mori in West LA. Great traditional sushi, they have reasonably priced lunch specials but you'd have to be careful to get out of there for under $50/pp during dinner.

Gjelina or The Tasting Kitchen on Abbot Kinney in Venice. Both these places are great, Gjelina is a bit less expensive and is also open for lunch. At Gjelina I like the pizzas, the BLT with egg, the mussels, hell I've liked pretty much everything I've eaten there (been prob 20 times). 

Hopefully these are enough choices. If you are looking for a specific cuisine let me know. || [deleted] || Craft in Century City. I may or may not work there.

Providence. 2 Michelin Stars. 

SLOWfish (sushi) in Huntington Beach. Not in LA or Long Beach but less of a drive from Long Beach than somewhere in LA.

Harbor House Cafe in Sunset Beach. It's along PCH (Hwy 1). 24 hour diner. It's awesome.

I've only been here like a month, so I don't have too much more for you. If you ever go to San Diego, let me know. || Shabu Shabu  at Shabu Shabu House in Little Tokyo. LT is in Downtown. Show up at 10:45 for lunch or 4::45 for dinner.

you already mentioned The Brewer's Art  
The Waterfront Hotel on Thames  
Tio Pepe's on Franklin St    

;) || Where are you staying? Makes a big difference in Los Angeles...

Most of the places I know in Los Angeles are downtown. Bottega Louie is a fantastic new, uhm, bottega located on 7th and Grand... After dinner you can go across the street to the creatively named ""7 Grand"" and get some whiskey.

Also downtown is Church & State, which is an excellent French bistro. Another cool place is Würstkuche, which is a new and very popular ""exotic grilled sausage"" restaurant with an excellent selection of beers on tap.

The Ivy (in Beverly Hills) is famous for breakfast/brunch... Other famous high-end ""power"" places include Spago for dinner and The Polo Lounge at The Beverly Hills Hotel for drinks.

Famous LA institutions include Pink's (hot dogs), Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles (obvious), Tito's Tacos (also obvious), The Apple Pan (burgers), Papa Cristo's (Greek), Canter's (Jewish deli), Bay Cities (deli), and Yogurtland (self-serve frozen yogurt).

None of the places in the last two paragraphs are Michelin starred (though we have a few of those, as I'm sure you know—I am partial to La Botte in Santa Monica), but they are fun and the food is good and most of them have a pretty long history.

The sushi in Los Angeles is fantastic. Almost certainly LA's best cuisine. A couple of my favorite spots include Boss Sushi on La Cienega and Zip Fusion downtown (for the sushi) and Katana on Sunset (for the ""scene"").

Anyway, I'm kind of tired of typing. If you have more specific requests based upon cuisine or location I'd be glad to do whatever I can to help. I also have a ton of reviews for Los Angeles restaurants on Yelp. http://tomburke.yelp.com/

Finally, NEVER talk shit about In-N-Out to Angelenos. You CAN NOT get In-N-Out at home. || Alright, I took many of your advice and went to [Father's Office](http://www.fathersoffice.com/). I waltzed in at 9:00, and the place was standing room only. I ordered a beer, and chatted with a couple people before managing to finagle a standing spot at the bar.

thejz [recommended Triple White Sage by Craftsman, if it was available](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9uj3o/ask_food_im_in_long_beach_and_la_until_saturday/c0ei2tu). Sadly, it was not. Having had an enjoyed Craftsman beers in the past (specifically, [1903](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2321/20054)), I decided to give their Hefeweizen a go.  TBH, I was underwhelmed. I felt like the peppercorn/clove overpowered the other layers in the beer. Bummer. As I was nearing the bottom, though, a bartender showed up saying he was ""returning the seat [he'd] stolen."" Coupling the unexpected posterior cushion with my getting to watch the final innings of the Dodgers losing to the Phillies in Game 1 of the NLCS *while in LA*, it made the last few sips of beer much sweeter.

(Short aside to say, I'm an Orioles boy through-and-through, but Phillies/Dodgers are a different league. And when sitting in a West coast bar watching an East Coast team fumble through beating the hometeam, it's more satisfying than I'd like to admit).

That was where the disappointment ended, though. I took your advice, ordered the Office Burger (med rare) with sweet potato fries. I also got a [BrewDog Juxtaposition](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/51399). There's an excellent beer for you. Surprisingly bright and citrus-y for a dark pils. Loved it. 

The fries came out first. Jesus Motherfucking Christ in a Handbasket. They were phenomenal. Warm. Sweet and salty. The bit of Cilantro. The dipping sauce! Served in a mini fry-basket? Holy god! They were fantastic. 

Then came the burger. For those who aren't aware, the Office Burger is a beef burger with caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and Gruyere cheese.The burger was damn fine. It was superb. The meat was properly done, and the onions were perfectly caramelized. The Gruyere was nutty and warm and mixed with the onions and beef, making something like the best French Onion soup burger thing you've had. Also I had arugula on a burger? I guess that makes me Hitler. Or am I only Hitler if I get Dijon on a burger? I get confused.

The thing that really set the burger up was the bread, though. Perfectly crusty, while being soft on the inside, but not getting soggy from the juices. It could have been a mess. It wasn't.

I can't decide if the offering put forth by Father's Office beats my hometown hero [the Abbey Burger Bistro](http://www.citypaper.com/eat/review.asp?rid=14550). I think the way to put it is as follows: the Office Burger would by and large beat any of the Abbey's individual offerings, but the options put forth by Abbey's menu, along with their build-your-own menu makes for a compelling group lunch.

Guys, I owe you. That was a surprisingly fantastic meal, at the last possible minute. We may wind up trying this again tomorrow night. || Wurstkuche in Downtown LA for bratwursts and beer, The Counter in Santa Monica for burgers, Daikokuya in Little Tokyo for ramen, and if you enjoy whiskey, you HAVE TO check out Seven Grand downtown.  || [deleted]",16/10/2009,2,20,1255652820,food,grab food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9uj3o/ask_food_im_in_long_beach_and_la_until_saturday/
"Dear /r/food, I'm trying to ween myself from fast food, and I need you!","I figured there would be a food subreddit, and I'm happy to see it's so popular.

I'm a healthy, fit (enough), young man who lives alone and am trying to minimize my near-daily fast food consumption;  I'm a terrible cook.  I recently received a panini machine and decided that making sandwiches myself would be an even cheaper (and perhaps healthier) alternative to frequenting Subway every time I eat out.

I went to the store.  I picked up spinach, that was easy.  Next I needed meat and cheese, I had no idea what to choose.  I was thinking some kind of deli sliced chicken, but I all I could find was basically turkey and ham.  I figured maybe turkey is sliced chicken in a sense, because it's a bird big enough to deli slice, so I grabbed sliced turkey pastrami.  For cheese I grabbed provolone, looked simple enough and I'm not fond of cheddar.  Next was bread, I stared blankly at all the different types of bread, and settled on a simple ""French"" bread.  It looks just like white bread, I'm not sure about the difference.

Anyways, I buttered the bread and cooked this all up in the panini machine, ensuring the cheese melted and the meat was cooked.  I added the spinach last to minimize it 'wilting to death' (as I would put it).

The result?  I was entirely displeased with the sandwich.  I almost venture to say it was gross.  It was also very smushed.  I basically felt like I'm entirely incapable of making something **as basic as a sandwich**.  Can anyone give me any advice on being a young single male who is entirely unfamiliar with all food products that constitute a good combination and meal?

.

**Followup:** Wow, thanks for all the useful replies everyone, I'm a bit overwhelmed at this point.  I'll be keeping this thread going through the week while I try out some of these suggestions.  I'll be posting replies as I go along and hopefully I'll have some better luck.  Thanks again everyone and keep posting if you have any further advice/tips/suggestions regarding how to build a delicious sandwich, or ingredients which bode well together, or a favorite meal.","Do you have a crock pot?  Honestly, I started cooking a few years ago, really enjoy it, and a crock pot can make you feel good about yourself.  You can't screw it up.  Add whatever you want to a roast and it will taste great!

I add a roast, 5-6 small red potatoes, add some baby carrots, I sometimes chop up celery and drop in, an onion (but leave the slices rather large), or, my favorite is to add a green bell pepper!  It gives the whole meal a kinda smokey flavor.  You can stop here, or if you're feeling ambitious, add some spices!  Salt and Pepper for sure, but also maybe some Mrs. Dashes or Emeril's seasoning, really just about anything you have.  I normally turn it on high when I leave in the morning, when I come home from lunch I turn it back to low (and stir), then back on high when I come home at 5:00.  Around 6 or 6:30 you have a homemade, nutritious, meal that tastes like you slaved over it, when really it takes <5 minutes to prepare! || Just some general advice for a new cook, **don't be too hard on yourself.**  

You will make some food that needs to be thrown out, nay, *must* be thrown out.  I've been cooking gourmet food for over a decade and I still make things when I'm experimenting that turn my stomach.  Sometimes, it just doesn't come out how you thought it would.  Cooking very well is a mixture of art and science.  It takes a great time to master, but the benefit of being able to cook expert meals at home is well worth the struggle.

I know this may sound idiotic, but watching cooking shows to pick up techniques and strategies for selecting meats, produce, etc. actually really helped me along.  Getting to watch people cook that are discussing what and why they are doing is a wonderful learning tool.  I still watch some from time to time.

As for fast food.  Focus on learning how to cook the food you love to buy from them, but better and healthier.  After enough practice you'll get to a point where you realize fast food is not only bad for you, but generally tastes like a mix of salt, cardboard, and lard with a dash of sugar.  I can't eat it at all anymore.

Good Luck!! || Hi, for a beginning cook the best recipes are usually italian. That's because they just use a few ingredients, but use really good ingredients (their powers combined, they form captain awesome). Especially because you say you want to learn to cook to stop eating so much fast food, you'll have to learn to shop as well. You can just randomly load things in your cart, without looking at labels, but chances are the stuff is fatter and more loaded with sugars and sodium that the fast food you're trying to avoid. Also, it will take some getting used to the new flavors. A good way to shop for your food is use all your senses, people may think you're weird for picking up food and smelling it, but if you do that regularly you'll be able to pick the best ingredients.
You did a good thing anyway by adding the spinach at the very last moment, so you might think you're a terrible cook, but that's a good cooking instinct. I could tell you a lot about what to put on your sandwich, but I don't know what your favorite foods are, but [this](http://www.recipezaar.com/cookbook.php?bookid=108166) might help you along || > I had no idea what to choose.

What do you normally order at subway?  Just get those ingredients, and put it together yourself.  Then do your best to perfect it by changing meat-to-cheese ratios, condiments, etc.  Then, start experimenting with different things.  Try swapping in new meats or cheeses or breads.   

As for the panini machine, usually those things come with some sort of recipe booklet?   **edit**: Or there [are recipes online](http://www.grouprecipes.com/tags/panini/recipe/1/rating).  I would try some of those instead of trying to guess your way to a good panini. || Right. Learn to make a grilled cheese. They're really hard to fuck up, and unless you make a proper mess of it, they're very tasty.

You'll need:

 * A stove
 * A frying pan (big flat thing. ""Skillet"" in the states? You might be able to use your panini machine for this)
 * A spatula of some description.
 * Some bread. Ideally some slices from a loaf
 * Some butter, or margarine, or any random vaguely yellow spreadable bread-covering substance.
 * Half an onion. Ideally a red onion, but anything will do
 * Pitted black olives. Pretty much anything will do.
 * Cheese. Again, anything will likely do. Cheddar works, provolone will probably be fine. I like Port Salut for this one, but whatever.
 * Proscuito or Parma Ham. Don't get the cheapest, but you don't need to go nuts. You could substitute almost any meat here, but I'd stick to this because a) it's really really nice, and b) I've never bought a really bad version of either of these things, so you shouldn't need too much supermarket-fu to get it right.

Put the pan on the stove to heat up. Low heat. Lower than that. The longer you cook this for, the better it'll be. Getting the cooking temps right is probably the trickiest part.

Butter the bread. The butter wants to be on the *outside* when it's cooked, so butter both slices on one side, put one down butter-side-up and put the next on top butter-side-down. We'll rearrange later.

Put the cheese on. Don't be shy with it ;)

Slice the onion. Onions have a ""blunt"" end and a ""pointy"" end (if in doubt, the blunt end is usually ""hairy""). Stick it on its side and slice down so the knife goes through the top and bottom. You're left with two halves, each with half a blunt end and half a pointy end each. Take one half, stick the cut side down, and slice about 1cm of the blunt end. Now take off the outer shell of the onion so you're left with the flesh. Now slice it. About 2mm thick slices.

If you fuck up the onion slicing, just attack it with a knife until you have diced onion :)

Separate the onion bits (you should be left with curved onion 'sticks'), and chuck a few onto your sandwich.

Slice up a few olives. Doesn't matter how, just make them smaller. Chuck them on too.

Now take a coupla slices of proscuito/parma ham and lay it on top. No need to use loads, if it's more than 2 layers thick anywhere, you probably have too much.

I like to chuck on another bit of cheese at this point (helps stick everything together), but whatever.

Now lift the top slice with all the toppings and put it into the pan. Take the second slice and put it on top (butter side up!)

Let it cook for a few minutes. You might want to check it a bit. It should go very slowly brown, but never black. Ideally, it should only be lightly brown after about 5 minutes. You can take the pan off the heat and adjust the stove if it's going too quick. If it's not starting to go a bit crispy after a few minutes, then you can turn up the heat.

After 5 mins or so you can turn it (but it's more important to get it nicely browned than cook for a specific time). The cheese should be fairly well melted, so it should all stick together nicely. Stick the spatula underneath, lift, and flip over.

Wait another few minutes for the other side to cook (probably won't need quite as long).

Lift it out of the pan, slice it in half, and enjoy. || Learning to cook for your self is one of the finer things in life, at least to me. At first there seems to be a real veil of mystery, with lots of failings. It took me a while to learn some basics but if a dumb ape like me can learn to cook, anyone can. 

Hands down, one of the best ways to learn about food, cooking and why you do certain things while cooking, is to watch Good Eats with Alton Brown. It’s really the only cooking show I can stand to watch. He explains not only how to make things, but why doing things a certain work or fail. There are lots of fun science facts and plenty of wonky humor to boot. My wife LOVES that I watch this show. 

You can find his recipes on the Food Network. http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/index.html

You can find some complete episodes online here: http://www.guba.com/general/search?query=good+eats&set=5

Here’s my site, where I display recipes I’ve learned from various sources. http://www.pbase.com/darter02/food
 || There are lots of qualified people posting, so I'll just chip in my 2c.

When you go grocery shopping, stick to the outside of the store.  Butcher, deli, produce, milk, eggs, bakery, etc.  The stuff on this inside is all expensive and all much less healthy for you.  If you have something specific you want, go and get it, but don't wander the aisles - and certainly don't do so on an empty stomach.

There's 1c, and here's my other: it sounds like what was wrong with your sandwich was a lack of flavour.  French bread, deli turkey, provolone cheese, and spinach are all good things, but you didn't have any sort of sauces on there.  Toss a little mayo and mustard into a bowl, mince some garlic (get a garlic press, by the way - there's an extra 1c, free of charge!) and throw that in, too, and mix it all up, and spread it on the bread before you grill it.

Oh, what the heck; I guess I'm feeling generous now that you've got me started.  [This book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Simple-Recipes/dp/0028610105) (or in [paperback](http://www.amazon.ca/How-Cook-Everything-Simple-Recipes/dp/0471789186)) has been very, very helpful to me.  The subtitle should catch your attention: ""simple recipes for great food"".  That's exactly what it is.  Further, he includes details on how to choose good ingredients, different ways of preparing food, and many, many recipes, often with several interesting variations.  From one of his recipes for pork chops, I could eat a different meal each night of the week.  This book will do a lot to teach you how to cook, if you let it.  You should definitely make a trip to Chapters and look for it.  I firmly believe that if anybody has room or time for only one cookbook on their shelf, and they're a new cook, this is the book for them.

So I guess you ended up with 4c, after all.  What a deal!  Best of luck, and I hope you fall in love with cooking.  There's no food better than good food you prepare for yourself.  =)

*edit:* Oh yeah; I somehow completely forgot to chip in this last 1c: don't worry about choosing ""the right bread"", or ""the right sandwich meat"".  Part of being new to all of this is finding that out for yourself.  Every time I go grocery shopping, I try to find a new kind of bread to buy.  Right now I'm on pumpernickel (a 675 g loaf is less than $3 (Canadian), on par with all the others) and it makes DYNAMITE tuna sandwiches.  Just experiment, and learn what you like by experimentation.  Don't let other people ever tell you something is ""bad"" because they didn't enjoy it.  (If they have objective reasons, like, ""the back and ribs cut of chicken is almost entirely bone, and hard to eat"", then you might want to pay attention.)  Tastes vary wildly and you owe it to yourself to try everything once.  You never know what you might love!  =) || Go online and get recipes.  Allrecipes.com is a good one.  Plan out 2 dishes for the week and go to the store and buy those ingredients. Start simple and follow the recipe. 
[Shepherd's pie](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Shepherds-Pie-VI/Detail.aspx) is on of the most simple things you can make.  Also chili is pretty easy too. Spaghetti is insanely easy and tasty too if you have the  right sauce.  Follow recipes for a while until you get a feel for the basics, then you can start experimenting.  Maybe take a recipe and tweak it a little.  As you get better, you'll be able to invent your own dishes but have to know basic skills first like chopping or how to heat milk without scorching it.  As for the sandwich, you were on the right track except for the french bread. A rye or something that is texas cut (big thick slices) is what you want to use in a panini machine.  

Next time, grab some thick cut square bread, pepper jack, mozzarella, ham, sliced pepperoni, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and pesto. Spread the pesto like mayo on the bread and build a sandwich.  Put the meat and cheese on and bake on high heat until the cheese melts.  Panini makers need to be up to heat before you put anything on them so once you get it pre-heated, put the sandwich on it and let it grill.  Don't apply pressure.  After it's golden brown, put some lettuce and sliced tomatoes on and boom: fucking grilled Italian panini.  || Spaghetti and stir-frys are very easy to make, since they use very few ingredients and, if you use the sauces that come in jars or packets, very hard to get wrong.

Spaghetti can be very simple - packet of pasta + jar of bolognese sauce. You can add mince, onion, carrots, zucchinis to liven it up a little. Stir frys are the same - cut up chicken or beef into strips, grab a packet of frozen stir fry vegetables (or buy fresh - onion, capsicum, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn or snow peas are all good), then add the sauce of your choosing, be it satay, black bean, sweet and sour, whatever! Boil up some rice and you're done. 

 || The other thing too...don't be afraid to practice to get the cooking down. Chefs spend years perfecting their craft, as do most other people who cook. My wife openly admits that when she started cooking, she sucked. Now she can throw a meal together lickety split out of whatever's on hand and it ROCKS.

You might look into the french approach, which uses lots of sauces.

Not to beat a commercial drum here, but I recently got a power juicer, because my wife can't drink OJ from the store, but we discovered at a demo that she COULD drink OJ that was freshly (as in 5 minutes ago) squeezed. So we bought the juicer at CostCo (Jack Lelane job, it spins, it's badass). That single thing changed our morning routine (and had other, unanticipated physical benefits...evidently juice from this thing is incredibly rich in fiber) so that we buy tons of fruit now.

Why is there such a difference between chinese food in america and china,"The Chinese food offered in America (Panda Express, Manchu Wok, kung-pao chicken) etc. seems to deviate a lot more from what is offered in China compared to say Japanese food in America compared to Japan (more similar-sushi, bentos, etc.). 

Why is that? Why did the Chinese in particular change what they serve after coming over to America? ","Because the ""Chinese Food"" you know was invented when Chinese migrant workers came to build the railroad in the 1800s. They were banned from owning land, so they lived in ghettos where they started their own businesses.

Since most American customers were not accustomed to the traditional Chinese cooking, the cooks began to adapt the foods to serve the customers' needs. As well, they may not have had access to proper ingredients, so they improvised. || Most of these comments are right. It's also important to remember that Chinese food varies greatly by region. Most Americanized Chinese food is loosely based on Hong Kong cuisine, just catered even more to American tastes (sweet). I always make it a point when finding a Chinese restaurant to find one that's busy and where most of the customers are Chinese. It's nearly always much more authentic.  || They didn't. Restaurants in areas with large amount of ethnic Chinese are very authentic. The frozen stuff sold in chains throughout the country is almost totally unrelated.  || Just like why Taco Bell or even chipotle are like ""authentic"" Mexican food from Mexico. It's just a style of food that has been ""Americanized"" and there is nothing wrong with that. Good food is good food.

Can I have a chinese food suggestion?,"I grew up with Panda Express being me ""Chinese food"" so lately I have been going to smaller Chinese places near me (family owned places) to get a more authentic feel of the culture. What is really good, I have tried egg foo yung, general tsos, Singapore rice noodles, and sweet and sour chicken.","Really, it's going to be very hard to find true authentic (well, as close as can be called authentic) unless you go to a China Town district and hunt around for where authentic can be found, or you just happen to live near a place known for putting it out there.

Either way, it's very uncommon to find local establishments producing much more beyond Chinese-American food. It's just that way.

Hek, you'd do better to study some good Chinese recipes, hunting down the ingredients yourself...but, who wants to do that except foodies! || >general tsos, Singapore rice noodles, and sweet and sour chicken

These are not really authentic dishes, although how many authentic flavours or ingredients are being used is going to vary from place to place.

If you can find an asian marketplace or another business run by asians, try asking where they like to eat  || [deleted] || thank you for the insight m8, have thy upvote || I will, thanks for the tip || Thank you, i will add those to the list
 || thanks! || Worked at an ""upper end"" Chinese establishment for 5 years. LOTS of fried, and basic sauce.

Displaced? What foods do you miss?,"Hi Reddit!

I'm a displaced Californian living in the south nearly 2,000 miles away from home. 

Some of the foods I miss are:

Homemade Tamales,
Hot thin pastrami sandwiches with hot yellow peppers (They don't know what Pastrami is here!),
Grilled Tri-tip (Again, they don't sell it here),
Denisons canned chili beans,
Jack in the box Tacos,
Panda Express Chinese fast food,
Whisky Peppercorn steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and Rice pilaf from The Hungry Hunter

I'm sure that I forgot to list some of the foods I miss. What are yours?!

EDIT: I was thinking of a couple more places we miss like Thinly sliced Carne Asada, See's candy, Plano Jerky, Rosemary's Ice Cream, Smith's bakery
","Californian in Iraq:

EVERYTHING.

That is all. || If I understand California at all, you also miss In-N-Out Burger. || American in China.

Cheese. || Living in the midwest, from California, I miss CEVICHE.  Not ceviche-style shit.  Ceviche.  All real Mexican mariscos. || From the East Coast and living in Colorado. I really miss good Chinese food. And good Indian food. The first night we got into town when we visited our parents we went to a Chinese restaurant and ate everything. || Tennessee in the UK: Chile Relleños (all Mexican food, actually), grits, fried okra, collard greens, reuben sandwiches, big juicy tomatoes, dill pickles (they are nowhere close to the same thing here), 5 Guys bugers, Jimmy John's, Fat Tire, Fresca. || Texan in Mass.

Want that Whataburger. Specifically, I want their ketchup. I also want Riscky's BBQ, delicious fresh avocados and mangoes, and the awesome Tex-Mex on every corner.  || Texan in Thailand. I miss tacos like crazy. Also anything deep fried and smothered in white gravy.  || Spaniard in Turkey... I don't even know where to start: pork in all its varieties, non overcooked meat, good lamb (lots of it, but it's awful, too old and tastes like wool), good foreign food, decent wine, good beer, good cheese, seafood...

Food is definitely the hardest thing to adapt to here. || As an American in Sweden: Mexican food, good pizza, and diverse Chinese (beyond standard Cantonese). Sharp Cheddar, English muffins, peanut butter. Asian and hispanic ingredients in general were hard to find (but not Turkish or Arab, which in turn are hard to find in MA... It's all about immigration patterns!).

As a Swede in America: rye bread, crisp bread, fresh unhomogenized milk, good strawberries, fil, sill, och semlor!
